# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script for building the CLI11 library, a command-line interface library for C++. This script handles the creation of either a static or interface library based on the `CLI11_PRECOMPILED` flag. It defines how the library should be compiled, including setting compile definitions and managing source files. The script also configures the inclusion of headers, ensuring they are treated as system headers when the project is included as a dependency in other projects, to suppress compiler warnings. Additionally, it includes installation instructions for the library and its headers, with conditional logic to handle different build scenarios, such as whether the library is precompiled or installed as a single file.
