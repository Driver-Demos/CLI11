# Purpose
This file is a CMake configuration script for generating documentation using Doxygen. It sets Doxygen options to extract all documentation and support the built-in STL, specifies a project brief, and defines a list of header files to document. It then adds a Doxygen documentation target that includes these files and a main page markdown file.
