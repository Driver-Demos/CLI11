# Purpose
The provided content is from a README file for the CLI11 library, which is a command-line parser for C++11 and beyond. This file serves as comprehensive documentation for developers who wish to integrate CLI11 into their C++ projects. It provides detailed instructions on installation, usage, and configuration of the library, including how to add options, flags, and subcommands to a command-line interface. The README also covers advanced topics such as validators, configuration files, and Unicode support, making it a broad resource for both basic and complex use cases. The file is crucial for developers as it not only explains the functionality and features of CLI11 but also guides them through the process of implementing a robust command-line interface in their applications.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive documentation for CLI11, a command line parser for C++11 and beyond. CLI11 is designed to offer a rich feature set with a simple and intuitive interface, making it suitable for both small and complex command line projects. It is a header-only library, meaning it can be easily included in projects without external dependencies beyond C++11.

Key features of CLI11 include:

1. **Ease of Use**: CLI11 is designed to be easy to include in projects, with a single header file and no external requirements. It supports a minimal syntax for defining command line options, making it straightforward to use.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The library is compatible with major compilers and platforms, including GCC, Clang, AppleClang, NVCC, and MSVC, and works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

3. **Comprehensive Option Handling**: CLI11 supports a wide range of option types, including flags, options with arguments, and subcommands. It allows for complex command line interfaces with features like option groups, validators, and configuration files.

4. **Subcommands and Option Groups**: CLI11 supports subcommands, allowing for nested command structures similar to tools like `git`. Option groups enable logical grouping of options for better organization and control.

5. **Configuration Files**: CLI11 can read configuration files in TOML or INI format, allowing for default values and settings to be specified outside of the command line.

6. **Unicode Support**: The library supports Unicode, ensuring that command line arguments are correctly handled across different platforms, particularly on Windows.

7. **Customization and Extensibility**: CLI11 allows for custom validators, transformers, and formatters, providing flexibility to adapt the library to specific needs.

8. **Documentation and Examples**: The documentation includes detailed explanations of features, usage examples, and a list of contributors. It also provides links to additional resources like the API documentation and a GitBook tutorial.

Overall, CLI11 is a powerful and flexible tool for building command line interfaces in C++, with a focus on ease of use, cross-platform compatibility, and comprehensive feature support.
