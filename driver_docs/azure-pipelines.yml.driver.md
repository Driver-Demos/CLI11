# Purpose
The provided file is a YAML configuration file for Azure DevOps Pipelines, specifically designed to automate the build and testing processes of a C/C++ project using GCC and other compilers. This file defines multiple jobs, each with specific tasks such as linting, building, and testing the code across various environments and configurations. It includes a matrix strategy to run builds on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and compilers (GCC, Clang) with varying C++ standards and options. The file is crucial for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows, ensuring that the codebase is consistently tested and built across different platforms and configurations, thereby maintaining code quality and compatibility. The use of templates and containerized environments further enhances the flexibility and scalability of the build process.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is an Azure DevOps pipeline definition for building and testing a C/C++ project using GCC and other compilers. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the `main` branch and any branches matching the pattern "v*". It defines several jobs, each with specific tasks and configurations, to ensure comprehensive testing and building across different environments and compiler settings.

Key technical details include:

1. **Variables**: The pipeline uses a set of variables to configure the build environment, such as `cli11.single`, `cli11.std`, `cli11.build_type`, and `cli11.options`. These variables control the build settings, including the C++ standard version, build type, and additional compiler options.

2. **Jobs**:
   - **CppLint**: This job runs a code style check using `cpplint` against the Google style guide on specified directories. It uses a Docker container (`helics/buildenv:cpplint`) for the environment.
   
   - **Build Only**: This job is configured to build the project using Visual Studio on Windows with ARM64 architecture. It uses a matrix strategy to specify different build configurations.
   
   - **Native**: This job builds the project natively on various operating systems and configurations, including different versions of macOS, Windows, and Linux. It uses a matrix strategy to test multiple C++ standard versions and precompilation settings.
   
   - **Meson**: This job sets up and builds the project using the Meson build system. It installs necessary tools like Meson and Ninja, sets up test directories, and runs the build and test commands.
   
   - **Docker**: This job builds the project using different versions of GCC and Clang compilers within Docker containers. It uses a matrix strategy to test various compiler versions and settings, ensuring compatibility and performance across different environments.
   
   - **Docker_new**: Similar to the Docker job, this job tests newer versions of GCC and Clang compilers, ensuring the project builds correctly with the latest compiler features and standards.

3. **Templates**: The pipeline uses templates for build, test, and CMake configurations, which are referenced in the steps of each job. These templates likely contain common build and test logic to be reused across different jobs, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.

Overall, this pipeline is designed to ensure that the C/C++ project is thoroughly tested and built across a wide range of environments and configurations, leveraging both native and containerized builds to maximize coverage and reliability.
