# Purpose
This script is a shell script designed to automate the process of formatting C++ source and header files using `clang-format`. It provides narrow functionality focused on code style consistency by applying a predefined style to all `.cpp` and `.hpp` files tracked by Git in the repository. The script first checks the version of `clang-format` to ensure compatibility, then formats the files according to the style specified in a configuration file, and finally checks for any differences in the files post-formatting using `git diff`. This script is typically used in a development environment to maintain code quality and consistency across a codebase.
