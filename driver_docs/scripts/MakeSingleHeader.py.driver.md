# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate a single header file from multiple source header files, primarily for C++ projects. It reads header files, processes them based on specific tags, and consolidates them into a single output file. The script uses regular expressions to identify and extract content from the headers, which are then organized into a dictionary-like structure called `HeaderGroups`. This structure allows for the categorization of header content based on actions such as "verbatim" or "set", enabling flexible content management. The script also supports optional namespace adjustments and macro replacements, making it versatile for different project configurations.

The script is intended to be executed as a standalone command-line tool, as indicated by the presence of the `argparse` module for handling command-line arguments. It provides options for specifying the output file, main header template, input files, namespace, tag, macro replacements, and version information. The script also attempts to retrieve the current Git tag to include versioning information in the generated header. This functionality is particularly useful for developers looking to streamline the inclusion of multiple headers into a single file, which can simplify distribution and integration of C++ libraries.

# Global Variables

---
### tag\_str
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The `tag_str` variable is a raw string that defines a regular expression pattern used to match and extract specific sections of text from a file. It is designed to identify blocks of text that start and end with a specific tag, capturing the name, action, and content within these blocks. The pattern is verbose and includes comments to explain each part of the regular expression.
- **Use**: This variable is used to compile a regular expression matcher in the `HeaderGroups` class, which is then used to parse and extract header information from files.


---
### DIR
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The `DIR` variable is a string that holds the directory path of the current script file. It is determined by using the `os.path.dirname` and `os.path.abspath` functions on the special `__file__` attribute, which represents the path to the script file being executed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to set the current working directory for subprocess operations, such as when running Git commands.


# Classes

---
### HeaderGroups<!-- {{#class:CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups}} -->
- **Members**:
    - `re_matcher`: A compiled regular expression matcher for parsing headers based on a tag.
- **Description**: The `HeaderGroups` class extends the dictionary to include functionality for reading and processing header files based on a specified tag expression. It uses a regular expression to parse the headers and supports actions such as 'verbatim' and 'set' to manage the content within the dictionary. The class also provides a method to post-process the stored data, converting sets into multi-line strings for easier handling.
- **Methods**:
    - [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.__init__`](#HeaderGroups__init__)
    - [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.read_header`](#HeaderGroupsread_header)
    - [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.post_process`](#HeaderGroupspost_process)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `dict`

**Methods**

---
#### HeaderGroups\.\_\_init\_\_<!-- {{#callable:CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.__init__}} -->
The `__init__` method initializes a `HeaderGroups` object by compiling a regular expression pattern based on a provided tag and setting up the object as a dictionary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tag`: A string representing the tag used to format the regular expression pattern for matching headers.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The method compiles a regular expression pattern using the provided `tag` and the predefined `tag_str` template, with flags for multiline, dot-all, and verbose modes.
    - It initializes the `HeaderGroups` object as a dictionary by calling the superclass `dict`'s `__init__` method.
- **Output**: The method does not return any value; it initializes the `HeaderGroups` object with a compiled regular expression matcher and sets it up as a dictionary.
- **See also**: [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups`](#CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeaderHeaderGroups)  (Base Class)


---
#### HeaderGroups\.read\_header<!-- {{#callable:CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.read_header}} -->
The `read_header` method reads a header file and updates the dictionary with items based on their specified actions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `filename`: The name of the file to be read, which contains header information to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the specified file and read its contents into a string.
    - Use a regular expression matcher to find all matches in the file content.
    - If no matches are found, issue a warning indicating no matches were found in the file.
    - Iterate over each match, extracting the name, action, and content.
    - If the action is 'verbatim', assert that the name is not already in the dictionary and add the content to the dictionary under the name.
    - If the action is 'set', update the dictionary entry for the name with a union of the existing set and the new content split into lines.
    - If the action is neither 'verbatim' nor 'set', raise a RuntimeError indicating an unrecognized action.
- **Output**: The method updates the dictionary (inherited from `dict`) with new entries or modifies existing ones based on the actions specified in the header file.
- **See also**: [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups`](#CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeaderHeaderGroups)  (Base Class)


---
#### HeaderGroups\.post\_process<!-- {{#callable:CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups.post_process}} -->
The `post_process` method converts any set values in the `HeaderGroups` dictionary into sorted, multi-line strings.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over each key in the `HeaderGroups` dictionary.
    - Checks if the value associated with the key is a set.
    - If the value is a set, it converts the set into a sorted list of strings joined by newline characters, and assigns this string back to the key in the dictionary.
- **Output**: The method modifies the `HeaderGroups` dictionary in place, converting set values to multi-line strings.
- **See also**: [`CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.HeaderGroups`](#CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeaderHeaderGroups)  (Base Class)



# Functions

---
### make\_header<!-- {{#callable:CLI11/scripts/MakeSingleHeader.make_header}} -->
The `make_header` function generates a single header file from a template and a list of files, optionally replacing macros and setting a namespace.
- **Inputs**:
    - `output`: The file path where the generated single header will be written; if None, the header is printed to the console.
    - `main_header`: The path to the main header template file that defines the structure of the single header.
    - `files`: A list of file paths to header files that will be processed and included in the single header.
    - `tag`: A string tag used to identify and process specific sections within the header files.
    - `namespace`: A string representing the namespace to be used in the generated header.
    - `macro`: An optional tuple containing two strings, representing the macro prefix to be replaced and the new prefix.
    - `version`: An optional string representing the version to be included in the generated header; defaults to the git description if not provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a HeaderGroups object with the provided tag.
    - Attempt to retrieve the current git description to set the 'git' key in the HeaderGroups object.
    - Iterate over the list of files, skipping directories, and read each header file into the HeaderGroups object.
    - Set the 'namespace' and 'version' keys in the HeaderGroups object, using the provided version or the git description.
    - Call the post_process method on the HeaderGroups object to format any sets into multiline strings.
    - Read the main header template file and format it using the HeaderGroups object to create the single header content.
    - If a macro replacement is specified, replace occurrences of the old macro prefix with the new one in the single header content.
    - Replace occurrences of 'CLI::' with the new namespace in the single header content.
    - If an output path is provided, write the single header content to the specified file and print a creation message; otherwise, print the single header content to the console.
- **Output**: The function outputs a single header file either to a specified file path or to the console, depending on the 'output' argument.
