# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of a command-line interface (CLI) application, likely using the CLI11 library. The tests are structured using the Catch2 testing framework, as indicated by the use of `TEST_CASE_METHOD`. The primary focus of these tests is to ensure the correct behavior of option and subcommand management within the CLI application. This includes verifying the addition of flags and options, handling of duplicate options, case sensitivity, underscore handling, and the correct construction of options and subcommands. The tests also cover the validation logic for options, ensuring that constraints such as required options, multi-option policies, and validator operations are correctly enforced.

The file is not an executable but rather a test suite that is likely part of a larger project. It is intended to be run in a testing environment to ensure the robustness and correctness of the CLI application's option parsing and validation logic. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases like incorrect construction and duplicate option handling, ensuring that the CLI application behaves as expected under various conditions. The use of validators and their operations, such as logical AND, OR, and negation, are also tested to ensure that the application can enforce complex validation rules on user input. Overall, this file is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of the CLI application by catching potential issues early in the development process.

# Data Structures

### Unstreamable<!-- {{#data_structure:Unstreamable}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `x_`: An integer member variable initialized to -1, representing a private data field.
- **Description**: The `Unstreamable` class is a simple C++ class that encapsulates a single private integer member variable `x_`, which is initialized to -1. It provides a default constructor, a getter method `get_x()` to access the value of `x_`, and a setter method `set_x(int x)` to modify the value of `x_`. The class is designed to be non-streamable by default, but an external operator overload for `>>` is provided to allow input streaming of `Unstreamable` objects, enabling the modification of `x_` through input streams.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`Unstreamable::Unstreamable`](#UnstreamableUnstreamable)
    - [`Unstreamable::get_x`](#Unstreamableget_x)
    - [`Unstreamable::set_x`](#Unstreamableset_x)

**Methods**

---
#### Unstreamable::Unstreamable<!-- {{#callable:Unstreamable::Unstreamable}} -->
The `Unstreamable` class provides a default constructor and methods to get and set an integer member variable `x_`.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The class `Unstreamable` is defined with a private integer member `x_` initialized to -1.
    - A default constructor `Unstreamable()` is provided, which does not perform any operations.
    - The method `get_x()` returns the value of the private member `x_`.
    - The method `set_x(int x)` allows setting the value of `x_` to a new integer value.
- **Output**: The class does not produce any output directly, but provides access to the integer member `x_` through its methods.

---
#### Unstreamable::get\_x<!-- {{#callable:Unstreamable::get_x}} -->
The `get_x` function returns the value of the private member variable `x_` from the `Unstreamable` class.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is a simple getter method that directly returns the value of the private member variable `x_`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the current value of the private member variable `x_`.
- **See also**: [`Unstreamable`](#Unstreamable)  (Data Structure)


---
#### Unstreamable::set\_x<!-- {{#callable:Unstreamable::set_x}} -->
The `set_x` function sets the private member variable `x_` of the `Unstreamable` class to the provided integer value `x`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: An integer value that will be assigned to the private member variable `x_` of the `Unstreamable` class.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes an integer parameter `x`.
    - The function assigns the value of `x` to the private member variable `x_`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.
- **See also**: [`Unstreamable`](#Unstreamable)  (Data Structure)



# Functions

---
### operator>><!-- {{#callable:operator>>}} -->
The `operator>>` function reads an integer from an input stream and assigns it to an `Unstreamable` object's internal state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `in`: A reference to an input stream (`std::istream`) from which data is read.
    - `value`: A reference to an `Unstreamable` object whose internal state will be set based on the input stream data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an integer variable `x` to 0.
    - Read an integer from the input stream `in` and store it in `x`.
    - Call the `set_x` method on the `Unstreamable` object `value` to set its internal state to `x`.
    - Return the input stream `in`.
- **Output**: Returns a reference to the input stream `in`.
