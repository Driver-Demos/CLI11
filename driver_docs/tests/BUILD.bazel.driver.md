# Purpose
The provided content is a build configuration file written in a format used by Bazel, a build and test tool. This file defines several build targets, including binaries, libraries, and tests, for a C++ project. The `cc_binary` rules specify the creation of executable binaries, such as "ensure_utf8" and "ensure_utf8_twice," by compiling the respective source files and linking them with the specified dependencies. The `cc_library` rule defines a library target named "catch_main," which includes source and header files, preprocessor definitions, and dependencies, particularly on the Catch2 testing framework. The `cc_test` rules define test targets, including "AppTest," which uses the binaries as data and sets local preprocessor definitions to reference their paths. Additionally, a list comprehension is used to generate multiple test targets dynamically, each corresponding to a different test source file, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage for various components of the software.
