# Purpose
This code is a C++ test file that utilizes the Catch2 testing framework to verify the behavior of a function named `do_nothing`. The primary purpose of this code is to ensure that the `do_nothing` function returns the expected value, which is checked to be 7. The inclusion of headers such as "CLI/CLI.hpp" and "CLI/Timer.hpp" suggests that this code might be part of a larger project involving command-line interface utilities, although these headers are not directly used in the provided snippet. The code provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on testing the linkage and return value of a specific function. It is not an executable on its own but rather a test file intended to be run within a testing framework to validate specific aspects of the codebase.
