# Purpose
This code is a C++ source file intended to serve as a test executable using the Catch2 testing framework. It provides narrow functionality, specifically setting up a test environment by defining `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN`, which instructs Catch2 to generate a main function automatically. This allows the file to be compiled and executed to run tests defined in other files that include this one. The inclusion of `"catch.hpp"` indicates that it relies on the Catch2 library, which is a popular unit testing framework for C++. The code is part of a project developed by the University of Cincinnati and is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause, as noted in the comments.
