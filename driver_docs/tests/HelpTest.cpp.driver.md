# Purpose
The provided C++ source code file is a comprehensive test suite for the CLI11 library, which is a command-line interface parser for C++. The file is structured using the Catch2 testing framework, as indicated by the inclusion of "catch.hpp" and the use of `TEST_CASE` macros. Each test case is designed to verify specific functionalities of the CLI11 library, particularly focusing on the generation and formatting of help messages for command-line applications.

The test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic help message generation, usage and footer customization, handling of deprecated and retired options, and the management of option groups. Additionally, the tests explore advanced features such as custom validators, subcommand handling, and the configuration of help and version flags. The file also includes tests for error handling and exit codes, ensuring that the library behaves correctly under various conditions. Overall, this file serves as a critical component in validating the robustness and flexibility of the CLI11 library's help and option management features.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI11.hpp`
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `app_helper.hpp`
- `catch.hpp`
- `fstream`
- `set`
- `string`
- `utility`
- `vector`


# Global Variables

---
### long\_string
- **Type**: `std::string`
- **Description**: The `long_string` variable is a static constant string that contains a lengthy description intended to test the handling of long lines in help documentation. It is defined as a `std::string` and initialized with a multi-line string literal.
- **Use**: This variable is used to test how the help handler manages long descriptions in the CLI11 library.


# Data Structures

---
### CapturedHelp<!-- {{#data_structure:CapturedHelp}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `app`: An instance of CLI::App initialized with the name 'My Test Program'.
    - `out`: A std::stringstream object used to capture standard output.
    - `err`: A std::stringstream object used to capture standard error.
- **Description**: The `CapturedHelp` struct is designed to facilitate testing of command-line interface (CLI) applications by capturing and managing output and error streams. It contains a `CLI::App` object for handling CLI operations, and two `std::stringstream` objects to capture and manipulate the output and error messages generated during the execution of CLI commands. The struct provides methods to run commands and reset the output and error streams, making it useful for testing scenarios where capturing and verifying CLI output is necessary.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`CapturedHelp::run`](#CapturedHelprun)
    - [`CapturedHelp::reset`](#CapturedHelpreset)

**Methods**

---
#### CapturedHelp::run<!-- {{#callable:CapturedHelp::run}} -->
The `run` function executes the `exit` method of the `CLI::App` object with a given error and captures the output and error streams.
- **Inputs**:
    - `e`: A constant reference to a `CLI::Error` object representing the error to be processed by the `exit` method.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `exit` method of the `app` object, passing the error `e`, and the `out` and `err` stringstreams as arguments.
    - The `exit` method processes the error and writes any output to the `out` and `err` streams.
    - The function returns the integer result of the `exit` method call.
- **Output**: An integer representing the exit code returned by the `exit` method of the `CLI::App` object.

---
#### CapturedHelp::reset<!-- {{#callable:CapturedHelp::reset}} -->
The `reset` function clears the contents of the `out` and `err` stringstreams in the `CapturedHelp` struct.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `clear()` on the `out` stringstream to reset its state and contents.
    - The function calls `clear()` on the `err` stringstream to reset its state and contents.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.
