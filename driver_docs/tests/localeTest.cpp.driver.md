# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to test the functionality of a custom locale setting, specifically focusing on the implementation of a custom thousands separator for numeric output. The file includes a class `CustomThousandsSeparator` that inherits from `std::numpunct<char>`, overriding the `do_thousands_sep()` and `do_grouping()` methods to define a custom separator ('|') and grouping pattern (groups of two digits). The code is part of a test case, utilizing the Catch2 testing framework, to verify the correct application of this custom locale to numeric options within a command-line application. The test case, wrapped in a preprocessor directive to check for runtime type information (RTTI), sets the custom locale globally and checks that the numeric options `FOO`, `BAR`, and `QUX` are correctly parsed and formatted according to the custom locale settings.

The file is not a standalone executable but rather a test component, likely part of a larger suite of tests for a command-line interface library, as indicated by the inclusion of "app_helper.hpp" and the use of `TApp`, which suggests a test application framework. The primary focus is on ensuring that the custom locale settings are applied correctly to the application's numeric options, demonstrating the integration of locale customization with command-line option parsing. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead serves as an internal validation tool for developers to ensure the robustness of locale handling within the application.

# Data Structures

---
### CustomThousandsSeparator<!-- {{#data_structure:CustomThousandsSeparator}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `CustomThousandsSeparator` class is a custom facet derived from `std::numpunct<char>` that overrides the default thousands separator behavior in C++ locales. It provides a specific implementation for the `do_thousands_sep` method to use a pipe character ('|') as the thousands separator and the `do_grouping` method to group digits in sets of two. This class can be used to customize the formatting of numbers in output streams by setting it as part of a locale.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`CustomThousandsSeparator::do_thousands_sep`](#CustomThousandsSeparatordo_thousands_sep)
    - [`CustomThousandsSeparator::do_grouping`](#CustomThousandsSeparatordo_grouping)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `std::numpunct<char>`

**Methods**

---
#### CustomThousandsSeparator::do\_thousands\_sep<!-- {{#callable:CustomThousandsSeparator::do_thousands_sep}} -->
The `do_thousands_sep` function returns a custom character used as a thousands separator in numeric formatting.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is a member of the `CustomThousandsSeparator` class, which inherits from `std::numpunct<char>`.
    - It overrides the `do_thousands_sep` method to return the character '|'.
- **Output**: The function returns the character '|' as the thousands separator.

---
#### CustomThousandsSeparator::do\_grouping<!-- {{#callable:CustomThousandsSeparator::do_grouping}} -->
The `do_grouping` function specifies the digit grouping pattern for formatting numbers, grouping digits in sets of two.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is a constant member function, meaning it does not modify any member variables.
    - It overrides the `do_grouping` method from the `std::numpunct<char>` class.
    - The function returns a string containing the character '\2', which indicates that digits should be grouped in sets of two.
- **Output**: A string containing the character '\2', which specifies the grouping pattern for digits.
