# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test suite designed to verify the functionality of boolean command-line options within an application. It utilizes the Catch2 testing framework, as indicated by the use of `TEST_CASE_METHOD`, to define test cases that ensure the correct behavior of boolean flags. The file includes two primary test cases: "True Bool Option" and "False Bool Option". Each test case uses the `GENERATE` function to iterate over a set of string representations of boolean values, such as "true", "on", "True", and "ON" for true values, and "false", "off", "False", and "OFF" for false values. The tests check that the application correctly interprets these string inputs as boolean flags, updating the `value` variable accordingly and verifying that the option is counted exactly once.

The code is structured to be part of a larger test suite, likely for a command-line application, as it includes the `app_helper.hpp` header, which presumably provides the necessary setup for the `TApp` class used in the test cases. The tests focus on ensuring that the command-line parser correctly handles boolean options, a critical aspect of command-line interface functionality. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as an internal validation tool to ensure the robustness and correctness of the application's command-line parsing capabilities.
