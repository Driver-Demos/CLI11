# Purpose
The content provided appears to be a fragment of a symbol or identifier, likely from a compiled binary or a mangled name in a C++ program, rather than a complete source code file. This suggests that the file might be part of a compiled library or executable, where `.br-bN3CLI10ParseErrorEa5` could represent a specific function, class, or error type related to command-line interface (CLI) parsing. The presence of "ParseError" indicates that this component is likely involved in error handling or reporting for parsing operations within a CLI context. Without additional context or source code, it is difficult to determine the exact functionality or scope, but it is likely part of a broader system dealing with command-line input processing.
