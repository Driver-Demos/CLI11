# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program that utilizes the CLI11 library to handle command-line arguments. The primary purpose of this code is to ensure that the command-line arguments are correctly processed as UTF-8 encoded strings, which is particularly important for cross-platform compatibility. The code includes a conditional compilation block that handles differences between Windows and non-Windows platforms. On Windows, it checks if the conversion of command-line arguments to UTF-8 has altered any of the arguments, and if so, it outputs the modified and original arguments to standard error and returns a non-zero exit code. This behavior ensures that the program can detect and handle any discrepancies in argument encoding on Windows systems.

The code is structured around the CLI11 library, which is included at the beginning of the file. The [`main`](#main) function is the entry point of the program, and it initializes a `CLI::App` object to manage the application's command-line interface. The use of `app.ensure_utf8(argv)` indicates that the program is designed to work with UTF-8 encoded input, which is a common requirement for modern applications that need to support internationalization. The code does not define any public APIs or external interfaces, as its primary function is to serve as a standalone executable for testing or demonstration purposes related to command-line argument handling.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a CLI application, ensures UTF-8 encoding of command-line arguments, and performs platform-specific checks on argument accessibility and integrity.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI application with a description.
    - Store the original command-line arguments in `original_argv`.
    - Convert the command-line arguments to UTF-8 encoding using `app.ensure_utf8(argv)`.
    - On Windows (_WIN32), iterate over each argument to compare the UTF-8 converted argument with the original; if they differ, print both and return the index + 1.
    - On Windows, also modify the first character of each argument to ensure accessibility.
    - On non-Windows systems, check if the original and converted argument pointers are the same; if not, return -1.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, a positive integer if there is a mismatch in arguments on Windows, or -1 if the argument pointers differ on non-Windows systems.
