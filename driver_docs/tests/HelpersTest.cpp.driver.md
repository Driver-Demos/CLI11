# Purpose
The provided C++ source code file is a comprehensive collection of unit tests designed to validate various utility functions and components within a software library, likely related to command-line interface (CLI) tools. The file includes a series of test cases that cover a wide range of functionalities, such as type conversion, string manipulation, file and directory validation, and mathematical operations. These tests are implemented using a testing framework, as indicated by the use of `TEST_CASE` macros, which are commonly found in frameworks like Catch2.

The code is organized into distinct sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the library's functionality. For instance, there are tests for type tools that check the conversion of different data types to strings, tests for string tools that handle string modifications and validations, and tests for validators that ensure the existence or non-existence of files and directories. Additionally, the code includes tests for mathematical operations like checked multiplication to prevent overflow, and tests for parsing and handling complex data structures like tuples and pairs. The file serves as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the library by verifying that each function behaves as expected under various conditions.

# Data Structures

---
### NotStreamable<!-- {{#data_structure:NotStreamable}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `NotStreamable` class is an empty class with no members or methods. It is used in the code to demonstrate a type that cannot be converted to a string using the `CLI::detail::to_string` function, as evidenced by the test case that checks if converting a `NotStreamable` object to a string results in an empty string. This class serves as a contrast to the `Streamable` class, which can be converted to a string.


---
### Streamable<!-- {{#data_structure:Streamable}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `Streamable` class is a simple, empty class that serves as a marker or tag to indicate that objects of this type can be streamed to an output stream. It is used in conjunction with an overloaded `operator<<` to provide a custom string representation when a `Streamable` object is output to a stream, specifically outputting the string "Streamable".


---
### t1<!-- {{#data_structure:t1}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `v1`: Represents the value 5.
    - `v3`: Represents the value 7.
    - `v5`: Represents the value -9.
- **Description**: The `t1` enum is a scoped enumeration with an underlying type of `signed char`, defining three named constants: `v1`, `v3`, and `v5`, which are assigned the values 5, 7, and -9 respectively. This enum can be used to represent a set of named integer constants within a small range, leveraging the compact storage of a `signed char`.


---
### test<!-- {{#data_structure:test}} -->
- **Type**: `enum class`
- **Members**:
    - `test1`: Represents the first enumerator in the `test` enum.
    - `test2`: Represents the second enumerator in the `test` enum.
    - `test3`: Represents the third enumerator in the `test` enum.
- **Description**: The `test` enum class is a strongly-typed enumeration that uses `std::uint8_t` as its underlying type. It defines three enumerators: `test1`, `test2`, and `test3`, which can be used to represent distinct values within the scope of the `test` enum. This enum class provides type safety and prevents implicit conversions to and from integer types, ensuring that only valid enumerator values are used.


---
### t2<!-- {{#data_structure:t2}} -->
- **Type**: `enum class`
- **Members**:
    - `enum1`: Represents the value 65.
    - `enum2`: Represents the value 45667.
    - `enum3`: Represents the value 9999999999999.
- **Description**: The `t2` enum class is a strongly-typed enumeration that uses a 64-bit unsigned integer as its underlying type. It defines three enumerators: `enum1`, `enum2`, and `enum3`, each associated with a specific integer value. This enum class is useful for representing a set of named constants with large integer values, ensuring type safety and avoiding implicit conversions.


# Functions

---
### operator<<<!-- {{#callable:operator<<}} -->
The `operator<<` function overloads the insertion operator to output the string "Streamable" when a `Streamable` object is passed to an `std::ostream`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out`: A reference to an `std::ostream` object where the output will be directed.
    - `Streamable`: A constant reference to a `Streamable` object, which is the object being output.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes an `std::ostream` reference and a `Streamable` object as parameters.
    - It uses the insertion operator `<<` to output the string "Streamable" to the `std::ostream` object.
    - The function returns the modified `std::ostream` reference.
- **Output**: A reference to the `std::ostream` object after the string "Streamable" has been inserted.
