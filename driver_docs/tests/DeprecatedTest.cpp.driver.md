# Purpose
This code is a C++ test case, likely part of a larger test suite, designed to verify deprecated features within a software project. It is implemented using a testing framework, as indicated by the `TEST_CASE` macro, which is commonly used in frameworks like Catch2. The test case is labeled "Deprecated: Empty" and currently does not test any deprecated features, simply asserting that `true` is true with the `CHECK(true)` statement. This suggests that the code is intended to serve as a placeholder or reminder for future tests related to deprecated functionality. The inclusion of a header file, "app_helper.hpp," implies that this file is part of a broader codebase, possibly a library or application, and is not a standalone executable.
