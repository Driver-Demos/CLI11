# Purpose
This code is a C++ test case designed to verify the compatibility of the CLI11 library with the inclusion of the Windows.h header file. It is part of a test suite, as indicated by the use of `TEST_CASE_METHOD`, which suggests it is not an executable but rather a test file intended to be run within a testing framework, likely Catch2 given the syntax. The test, named "WindowsTestSimple," checks that a flag can be added and correctly counted when the application is run with the `-c` or `--count` options. This code provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on ensuring that the CLI11 library functions correctly in a Windows environment when Windows-specific headers are included.
