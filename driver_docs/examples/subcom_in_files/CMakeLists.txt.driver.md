# Purpose
The file contains a command to add a command-line executable named `subcommand_main` using the source files `subcommand_main.cpp`, `subcommand_a.cpp`, and `subcommand_a.hpp`. This is likely part of a build configuration script, where the `add_cli_exe` function is used to define and compile a command-line interface executable from the specified source files.
