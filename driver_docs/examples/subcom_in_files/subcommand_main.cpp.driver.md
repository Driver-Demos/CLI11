# Purpose
This code is a C++ executable, specifically a command-line application that utilizes the CLI11 library to handle command-line arguments. It provides narrow functionality focused on setting up and parsing subcommands, as indicated by the inclusion of "subcommand_a.hpp" and the call to `setup_subcommand_a(app)`. The main function initializes a `CLI::App` object, which represents the command-line interface, and requires at least one subcommand to be specified by the user. The use of `CLI11_PARSE` suggests that the application is designed to parse and execute commands based on user input, making it suitable for applications that need modular command-line interfaces. The code is structured to allow for additional subcommands and configurations, as indicated by the placeholder comments for further setup.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `subcommand_a.hpp`
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a CLI application, sets up subcommands, ensures at least one subcommand is provided, and parses command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI application object `app` with a description placeholder.
    - Call [`setup_subcommand_a`](subcommand_a.cpp.driver.md#setup_subcommand_a) to configure a specific subcommand within the application.
    - Enforce that at least one subcommand must be provided by the user using `app.require_subcommand()`.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using `CLI11_PARSE`, which processes the input arguments according to the defined subcommands and options.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`setup_subcommand_a`](subcommand_a.cpp.driver.md#setup_subcommand_a)
