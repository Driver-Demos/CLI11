# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that provides a narrow functionality focused on setting up and executing a specific subcommand, referred to as "Subcommand A," within a command-line interface (CLI) application. It includes the necessary declarations for integrating with the CLI11 library, as indicated by the inclusion of `<CLI/CLI.hpp>`. The `SubcommandAOptions` struct is defined to encapsulate the options specific to this subcommand, such as a file name and a boolean flag `with_foo`. The file declares two functions: `setup_subcommand_a`, which is likely responsible for configuring the subcommand within the CLI application, and `run_subcommand_a`, which executes the subcommand using the provided options. This header is intended to be included in other C++ source files where the subcommand's setup and execution logic will be implemented.

- `string`


# Data Structures

---
### SubcommandAOptions<!-- {{#data_structure:SubcommandAOptions}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `file`: A string representing the file associated with Subcommand A.
    - `with_foo`: A boolean indicating whether the 'foo' option is enabled for Subcommand A.
- **Description**: The `SubcommandAOptions` struct is a simple data structure designed to encapsulate the options available for Subcommand A in a command-line interface application. It contains two members: `file`, which is a string specifying the file to be used, and `with_foo`, a boolean that determines if the 'foo' feature is activated. This struct helps in organizing and managing the options related to Subcommand A efficiently.
