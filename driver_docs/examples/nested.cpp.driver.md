# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to handle command-line interface (CLI) operations for a "Vision Application." It utilizes the CLI11 library, a powerful tool for creating command-line interfaces in C++. The primary purpose of this code is to define a structured command-line interface that allows users to interact with the application through various commands and options. The main technical components include the creation of a main application object (`CLI::App app`) and the definition of subcommands and options for configuring camera settings. The code provides a clear structure for handling different camera configurations, such as "mvcamera" for MatrixVision Camera Configuration and "mock" for Mock Camera Configuration, each with specific options for configuration files and paths.

The code is organized to facilitate the addition of subcommands and options, making it extensible for future enhancements. It defines a public API for interacting with the application via the command line, allowing users to access help information, check the application version, and configure camera settings. The use of subcommands and options demonstrates a modular approach, where each subcommand can have its own set of options and requirements. This design allows for a flexible and user-friendly interface, enabling users to configure the application according to their needs. The code is intended to be compiled and executed as a standalone application, providing a command-line interface for configuring and managing camera settings within the Vision Application.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface for a vision application, allowing configuration of camera settings through subcommands.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object named 'app' with the description 'Vision Application'.
    - Set a flag '--help-all' to expand all help messages and a flag '--version' to get the version of the application.
    - Add a subcommand 'camera' to 'app' for configuring the application camera, allowing 0 or 1 subcommands.
    - Create a subcommand 'mvcamera' under 'camera' for MatrixVision Camera Configuration, with an option to specify a configuration file, defaulting to 'mvcamera_config.json'.
    - Create a subcommand 'mock' under 'camera' for Mock Camera Configuration, requiring a path option that must be an existing path.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using CLI11_PARSE macro with the 'app' object.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value, as it is the entry point of the application.
