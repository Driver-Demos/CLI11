## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](subcom_in_files/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/examples/subcom_in_files` directory configures the build system to create an executable named `subcommand_main` from the source files `subcommand_main.cpp`, `subcommand_a.cpp`, and `subcommand_a.hpp`.
- **[subcommand_a.cpp](subcom_in_files/subcommand_a.cpp.driver.md)**: The `subcommand_a.cpp` file sets up and implements a subcommand for a command-line interface, allowing options to be specified and executed using a shared pointer to manage option data.
- **[subcommand_a.hpp](subcom_in_files/subcommand_a.hpp.driver.md)**: The `subcommand_a.hpp` file defines the structure and functions necessary to set up and execute Subcommand A within the CLI11 framework, including options for file handling and a boolean flag.
- **[subcommand_main.cpp](subcom_in_files/subcommand_main.cpp.driver.md)**: The `subcommand_main.cpp` file demonstrates setting up a command-line interface application using the CLI11 library, including the requirement of at least one subcommand.
