# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program that demonstrates the use of the CLI11 library to handle command-line arguments. The primary purpose of this code is to configure and parse command-line options and flags, providing a structured way to manage user inputs. The program defines several command-line options, including a print flag (`-p,--print`), a file name option (`-f,--file`), a counter (`-c,--count`), a repeatable flag (`--flag`), and a double value option (`-d,--double`). Each option is configured to capture its default string representation, which is a feature of the CLI11 library that allows the program to handle default values more effectively.

The code is structured around the `CLI::App` object, which serves as the central component for managing command-line arguments. The program includes functionality to print the current configuration if the print flag is set, showcasing the ability to output the configuration state. This is achieved through the `app.config_to_str()` method, which serializes the configuration to a string. The program also demonstrates how to access and display the values and counts of the options and flags provided by the user. Overall, this file serves as an example of how to use the CLI11 library to create a command-line interface with configurable options and flags, making it a useful reference for developers looking to implement similar functionality in their applications.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application to parse and handle various command-line options and flags, and optionally prints the configuration or processes the input arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object with a description 'configuration print example'.
    - Add a flag '-p,--print' to the app to print configuration and exit, which is not configurable.
    - Add an option '-f,--file,file' to capture a file name, storing it in a string variable 'file', and set it to capture the default string and run callback for default.
    - Add an option '-c,--count' to capture an integer count, storing it in an integer variable 'count', and set it to capture the default string.
    - Add a flag '--flag' to capture an integer value 'v', allowing it to be passed multiple times, and set it to capture the default string.
    - Add an option '-d,--double' to capture a double value, storing it in a double variable 'value', and set it to capture the default string.
    - Set the quote character for the configuration formatter to double quotes.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using CLI11_PARSE macro.
    - Check if the '--print' option is set; if so, print the configuration to the standard output and exit the program.
    - If '--print' is not set, print the processed values of the file, count, flag, and double options to the standard output.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value '0' indicating successful execution.
