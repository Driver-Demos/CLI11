# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program that utilizes the CLI11 library to parse command-line arguments. The primary functionality of this code is to provide a command-line interface that allows users to specify a "level" setting through command-line options. The program defines an enumeration `Level` with three possible values: High, Medium, and Low. It uses a `std::map` to associate string representations ("high", "medium", "low") with these enumeration values. The CLI11 library's `CheckedTransformer` is employed to ensure that the input from the command line is valid and corresponds to one of the predefined levels, with case-insensitive matching.

The code is structured around the [`main`](#main) function, which is typical for an executable program. It sets up a `CLI::App` object to manage the command-line interface, adds an option for the level setting, and uses the `CLI11_PARSE` macro to handle the parsing process. The program outputs the received enumeration value to the standard output, demonstrating the use of CLI11's built-in enum streaming capabilities. This file is focused on providing a specific functionality related to command-line parsing and does not define a public API or external interfaces beyond the command-line options it supports.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `iostream`
- `map`
- `string`


# Data Structures

---
### Level<!-- {{#data_structure:Level}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `High`: Represents a high level.
    - `Medium`: Represents a medium level.
    - `Low`: Represents a low level.
- **Description**: The `Level` enum class defines three distinct levels: High, Medium, and Low, which are used to categorize or specify the intensity or priority of a setting. This enum is strongly typed and scoped, ensuring type safety and preventing implicit conversions, which is particularly useful in applications where levels need to be explicitly managed and compared.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application to parse and validate a level setting from user input, then outputs the received level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object to handle command-line arguments.
    - Define an enum `Level` with possible values `High`, `Medium`, and `Low`, and set a default level to `Low`.
    - Create a map to associate string representations ('high', 'medium', 'low') with the corresponding `Level` enum values.
    - Add an option to the CLI app to accept a level setting, making it a required argument and using a `CheckedTransformer` to validate and transform the input based on the map, ignoring case.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using `CLI11_PARSE`, which processes the input according to the defined options.
    - Output the received level using CLI11's enum streaming capability.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function outputs the received level setting to the standard output stream.
