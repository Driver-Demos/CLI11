# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program that utilizes the CLI11 library to parse command-line arguments. It provides narrow functionality, specifically designed to handle command-line input for a simple application named "My app." The code defines an array of two integers and sets up a command-line option `--a` to modify this array, capturing its default string representation. The program then parses the command-line arguments and outputs "pass" to the console, indicating successful execution. The inclusion of the CLI11 library suggests that this code is intended for scenarios where command-line interface parsing is required, and it is not a library or header file meant for import elsewhere.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `array`
- `iostream`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a CLI application that accepts an array option and prints 'pass' upon successful parsing of command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a std::array `a` with two integers, 0 and 1.
    - Create a CLI application object `app` with the description 'My app'.
    - Add an option `--a` to the CLI application that maps to the array `a` and captures its default string representation.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using `app.parse(argc, argv)`.
    - Print 'pass' to the standard output.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
