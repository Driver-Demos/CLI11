## Files
- **[cli11_app_fuzz.cpp](fuzz/cli11_app_fuzz.cpp.driver.md)**: The `cli11_app_fuzz.cpp` file implements a fuzz testing function for the CLI11 library, designed to test the robustness of command-line parsing by generating and parsing random input strings.
- **[cli11_file_fuzz.cpp](fuzz/cli11_file_fuzz.cpp.driver.md)**: The `cli11_file_fuzz.cpp` file implements a fuzzing test for the CLI11 library, focusing on parsing and configuration file handling using the LLVM fuzzer.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](fuzz/CMakeLists.txt.driver.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/fuzz` directory configures the build system for fuzz testing executables and targets within the CLI11 project, including setting up fuzzing targets and custom commands for application and file fuzzing.
- **[fuzz_dictionary1.txt](fuzz/fuzz_dictionary1.txt.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_dictionary1.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of command-line options and flags for fuzz testing.
- **[fuzz_dictionary2.txt](fuzz/fuzz_dictionary2.txt.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_dictionary2.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of strings for fuzz testing, including various flags, options, and other command-line related terms.
- **[fuzzApp.cpp](fuzz/fuzzApp.cpp.driver.md)**: The `fuzzApp.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase implements a fuzzing application for testing command-line interface options, including the generation, modification, and comparison of various command-line options and flags.
- **[fuzzApp.hpp](fuzz/fuzzApp.hpp.driver.md)**: The `fuzzApp.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the `FuzzApp` class and several wrapper classes to facilitate fuzz testing of command-line applications with various interfaces and options.
- **[fuzzCommand.cpp](fuzz/fuzzCommand.cpp.driver.md)**: The `fuzzCommand.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase is responsible for setting up and executing a command-line interface application using fuzz testing data, handling any parsing errors that occur.
