The `fuzz` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains various files dedicated to implementing and configuring fuzz testing for the CLI11 library, including source files for fuzz testing applications and commands, configuration files for the build system, and dictionaries for command-line options and flags.


## Files
- **[cli11_app_fuzz.cpp](cli11_app_fuzz.cpp.md)**: The `cli11_app_fuzz.cpp` file implements a fuzz testing function for the CLI11 library, designed to test the robustness of command-line parsing by generating and parsing random input strings.
- **[cli11_file_fuzz.cpp](cli11_file_fuzz.cpp.md)**: The `cli11_file_fuzz.cpp` file implements a fuzzing test for the CLI11 library, focusing on parsing and configuration file handling using the LLVM fuzzer.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/fuzz` directory configures the build system for fuzz testing executables and targets within the CLI11 project, including setting up fuzzing targets and custom commands for application and file fuzzing.
- **[fuzz_dictionary1.txt](fuzz_dictionary1.txt.md)**: The `fuzz_dictionary1.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of command-line options and flags for fuzz testing.
- **[fuzz_dictionary2.txt](fuzz_dictionary2.txt.md)**: The `fuzz_dictionary2.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of strings for fuzz testing, including various flags, options, and other command-line related terms.
- **[fuzzApp.cpp](fuzzApp.cpp.md)**: The `fuzzApp.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase implements a fuzzing application for testing command-line interface options, including the generation, modification, and comparison of various command-line options and flags.
- **[fuzzApp.hpp](fuzzApp.hpp.md)**: The `fuzzApp.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the `FuzzApp` class and several wrapper classes to facilitate fuzz testing of command-line applications with various interfaces and options.
- **[fuzzCommand.cpp](fuzzCommand.cpp.md)**: The `fuzzCommand.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase is responsible for setting up and executing a command-line interface application using fuzz testing data, handling any parsing errors that occur.
