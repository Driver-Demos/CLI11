The `fuzz_dictionary2.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of strings for fuzz testing, including various flags, options, and other command-line related terms.

# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a list of recommended dictionary entries, likely used for a software tool that involves text processing, such as a spell checker, code linter, or a fuzzer. Each entry in the list represents a string or keyword that the software might recognize or utilize during its operation. The entries include single characters, flags, options, and other identifiers that could be used for configuration or command-line arguments. The presence of terms like "flag", "opt", "tup", and "wrap" suggests that these entries might be used to define or modify the behavior of the software, possibly indicating different modes, settings, or features. The list serves as a reference or a predefined set of tokens that the software can handle or expect during execution.
