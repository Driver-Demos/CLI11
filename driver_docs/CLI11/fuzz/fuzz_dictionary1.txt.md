The `fuzz_dictionary1.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a recommended dictionary of command-line options and flags for fuzz testing.

# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a list of command-line options, flags, and potential configuration parameters used within a software application. This list likely serves as a reference or dictionary for parsing command-line arguments, enabling the software to recognize and process various options and flags that users might input. The entries include both short and long-form options (e.g., "-a", "--flag1"), as well as placeholders for structured data (e.g., "<option>", "<vector>"). Additionally, the presence of terms like "config", "enable", and "help" suggests that these options may be used to configure the software's behavior, enable specific features, or provide user assistance. This file is essential for ensuring that the software can interpret and respond to user commands accurately.
