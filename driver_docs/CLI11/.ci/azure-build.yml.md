The `azure-build.yml` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the steps for configuring and building the project using CMake on both Unix and Windows systems in an Azure pipeline.

# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, likely used in a DevOps environment to automate the build process of a software project. The file defines a series of steps to be executed, starting with the creation of a build directory, which is necessary for organizing the build artifacts. It then uses a CMake task to configure the build system with specific arguments, such as setting compiler standards and enabling warnings as errors, which are dynamically populated using variables. The subsequent steps involve building the project, with separate commands for Unix and Windows environments, determined by the operating system condition checks. This setup ensures that the software is built consistently across different platforms, facilitating cross-platform development and testing.
