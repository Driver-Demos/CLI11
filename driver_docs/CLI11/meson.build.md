The `meson.build` file in the `CLI11` codebase configures the build system for the CLI11 project, specifying project details, compiler options, header files, and conditional compilation settings.

# Purpose
The provided file is a Meson build configuration file, which is used to define the build process for a C++ project named "CLI11". This file specifies various build settings, such as the project's version, license, and required Meson version, and it sets default compiler options like the C++ standard and warning levels. It includes logic to handle mutually exclusive build options, such as using a single-file header or precompiled headers, and it lists the header files necessary for the project. The file also configures compiler-specific warning flags and sets up the inclusion of directories and dependencies. Additionally, it defines how the library should be built and installed, including generating pkg-config files if precompiled headers are used. The relevance of this file to the codebase is significant, as it orchestrates the entire build process, ensuring that the project is compiled with the correct settings and dependencies.
# Content Summary
This file is a Meson build configuration script for the CLI11 project, which is a C++ library. The script defines the project's metadata and build options, including the project name 'CLI11', the programming language 'cpp', and the license type 'BSD-3-clause'. It specifies that the Meson build system version must be at least 0.60 and sets default options such as using the C++11 standard and a warning level of 3.

The script dynamically determines the project's version by executing a Python script, `ExtractVersion.py`, and captures its output. It retrieves the C++ compiler using `meson.get_compiler('cpp')` and defines two build options: `single-file-header` and `precompiled`. These options are mutually exclusive, and an error is raised if both are enabled simultaneously.

The script lists the header files required for the CLI11 library, categorizing them into main headers and implementation headers. It includes a subdirectory for single-include files and sets up include directories for the project.

Compiler-specific warning flags are configured based on the compiler's identity and version. For GCC version 4.9 and above, the `-Weffc++` flag is added, while Clang compilers receive additional warnings such as `-Wcast-align` and `-Wmissing-declarations`.

If the `precompiled` option is enabled, the script compiles a library named 'CLI11' from the `Precompile.cpp` source file, with specific preprocessor definitions and installation instructions. It also generates a pkg-config file for the library. The headers are installed under the 'CLI' subdirectory.

A dependency object, `CLI11_dep`, is declared to manage the library's sources, linking, and include directories, and it overrides the default 'CLI11' dependency with this configuration.

Finally, if the `tests` option is enabled, the script includes a subdirectory for tests, allowing for the integration of test cases into the build process.
