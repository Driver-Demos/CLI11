The `src` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains essential build configuration and implementation files for the CLI11 library, including `CMakeLists.txt` for build setup and `Precompile.cpp` for internal header inclusions.


## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/src` directory configures the build process for the CLI11 library, handling both precompiled and interface library setups, and includes installation instructions.
- **[Precompile.cpp](Precompile.cpp.md)**: The `Precompile.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase includes various internal implementation headers related to application, argument, configuration, encoding, formatting, option handling, string tools, and validators.
