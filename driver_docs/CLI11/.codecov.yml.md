The `.codecov.yml` file in the `CLI11` codebase configures Codecov to ignore coverage data from specified directories and sets branch detection preferences for the gcov parser.

# Purpose
This YAML configuration file specifies settings for a code coverage tool. The `ignore` section lists directories or files, such as "tests" and "docs," that should be excluded from coverage analysis. The `parsers` section configures the `gcov` parser to detect branches in conditional and loop constructs, while ignoring method and macro branches.
