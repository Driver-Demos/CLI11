The `.gitignore` file in the `CLI11/docs` directory specifies that all files within the `html` and `latex` directories should be ignored by Git.

# Purpose
The file contents specify a set of path patterns, likely used in a `.gitignore` file, to exclude all files and directories under the `/html/` and `/latex/` directories from being tracked by version control in a Git repository. This helps in preventing unnecessary or generated files from being committed to the repository.
