The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `CLI11/docs` configures Doxygen documentation generation for the CLI11 project, including settings for extracting all documentation and supporting STL, and specifies the source files and main page for the documentation.

# Purpose
This file is a CMake configuration script for generating documentation using Doxygen. It sets Doxygen options to extract all documentation and support the built-in STL, specifies a project brief, and defines a list of header files to document. It then adds a Doxygen documentation target that includes these files and a main page markdown file.
