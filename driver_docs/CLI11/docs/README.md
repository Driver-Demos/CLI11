The `docs` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains configuration files for generating Doxygen documentation, including a `.gitignore` for ignoring certain directories, a `CMakeLists.txt` for configuring documentation settings, a `Doxyfile` for detailed Doxygen configuration, and a `mainpage.md` for the main overview of the API documentation.


## Files
- **[.gitignore](.gitignore.md)**: The `.gitignore` file in the `CLI11/docs` directory specifies that all files within the `html` and `latex` directories should be ignored by Git.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in `CLI11/docs` configures Doxygen documentation generation for the CLI11 project, including settings for extracting all documentation and supporting STL, and specifies the source files and main page for the documentation.
- **[Doxyfile](Doxyfile.md)**: The `Doxyfile` in the `CLI11` codebase is a configuration file for Doxygen, detailing settings for generating documentation for the CLI11 project, including project name, output formats, and various options for controlling the appearance and content of the generated documentation.
- **[mainpage.md](mainpage.md.md)**: The `mainpage.md` file provides an overview of the Doxygen API documentation for the CLI11 parser, including descriptions of its main classes and related topic groups.
