The `CLI11precompiled.pc.in` file is a template for generating a pkg-config file for the CLI11 C++ command line parser, specifying installation paths and compilation flags.

# Purpose
This file is a pkg-config metadata file for the CLI11 library, a C++ command line parser. It defines variables for installation paths and includes compiler and linker flags necessary for building applications that depend on CLI11, such as include directories and library paths. The file facilitates the integration of CLI11 into projects by providing essential build information.
