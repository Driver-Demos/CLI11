The `CLI11GeneratePkgConfig.cmake` file is responsible for generating and installing the `CLI11.pc` pkg-config file based on whether the CLI11 library is precompiled or not.

# Purpose
This CMake script configures and installs a pkg-config file for the CLI11 library. It conditionally selects between two template files, "CLI11precompiled.pc.in" or "CLI11.pc.in", based on whether the `CLI11_PRECOMPILED` option is set, and generates the "CLI11.pc" file. The generated file is then installed to the pkg-config directory within the data directory specified by CMake.
