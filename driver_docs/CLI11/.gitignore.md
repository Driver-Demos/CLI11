The `.gitignore` file in the `CLI11` codebase specifies patterns for files and directories to be excluded from version control, including build artifacts, editor configurations, and package management files.

# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It lists patterns for build artifacts, editor temporary files, and dependency directories, such as `node_modules`, to prevent them from being included in version control.
