The `.clang-format` file in the `CLI11` codebase specifies C++ code formatting rules based on the LLVM style, with custom settings for indentation, line length, and spacing.

# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration file for the Clang-Format tool, which is used to automatically format C++ code according to specified style guidelines. This file is written in YAML format and contains settings that dictate how the code should be formatted, such as indentation width, line length, and brace positioning. The configuration is based on the LLVM style but includes customizations like setting the column limit to 120 characters and specifying that tabs should not be used for indentation. The file provides narrow functionality focused on code formatting, ensuring consistency and readability across the codebase. By defining these style rules, the file helps maintain a uniform coding standard, which is crucial for collaborative development and code maintenance.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file for a C++ codebase, specifically a `.clang-format` file, which is used to define coding style guidelines for the Clang-Format tool. This tool automatically formats C++ code according to the specified rules, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

Key technical details include:

- **Language and Style**: The configuration is set for C++ (`Language: Cpp`) and is based on the LLVM style (`BasedOnStyle: LLVM`), which is a widely used coding style in the C++ community.

- **Column Limit**: The maximum line length is set to 120 characters (`ColumnLimit: 120`), which helps maintain readability by preventing excessively long lines.

- **Indentation**: Indentation is configured with a width of 4 spaces (`IndentWidth: 4`), and tabs are not used for indentation (`UseTab: Never`). This ensures uniformity in code appearance.

- **Bin Packing**: Both arguments and parameters are not bin-packed (`BinPackArguments: false`, `BinPackParameters: false`), meaning each argument or parameter will be placed on a separate line if they do not fit within the column limit.

- **Sorting and Spacing**: Includes are sorted (`SortIncludes: true`), which helps in maintaining a clean and organized list of header files. Spaces before parentheses are never allowed (`SpaceBeforeParens: Never`), and there are two spaces before trailing comments (`SpacesBeforeTrailingComments: 2`).

- **Standard**: The C++ standard is set to C++11 (`Standard: Cpp11`), indicating that the code should be compatible with features introduced in this version of the language.

- **Miscellaneous**: The configuration specifies that short functions can be on a single line (`AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: All`), and string literals are allowed to break across lines (`BreakStringLiterals: true`).

This configuration file is crucial for developers as it enforces a consistent coding style, which is essential for maintaining code readability and quality across a team. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can ensure that their code is formatted uniformly, making it easier to read, review, and maintain.
