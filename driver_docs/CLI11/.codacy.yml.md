The `.codacy.yml` file in the `CLI11` codebase configures Codacy analysis tools, enabling RuboCop, duplication, and metrics engines while disabling coverage, and specifies paths and file types to ignore.

# Purpose
This YAML configuration file is used to set up a code analysis tool, specifying which engines and languages to enable or disable. It enables the `rubocop`, `duplication`, and `metrics` engines, while disabling `coverage`, and specifies `cppcheck` for C++ language analysis. It also defines certain paths and file types to ignore during analysis, such as style-related files, directories under "fuzz" and "scripts", and markdown files.
