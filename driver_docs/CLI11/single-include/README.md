The `single-include` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains configuration files for generating a single-header version of the CLI11 library, including `CLI11.hpp.in` as a template, and build scripts `CMakeLists.txt` and `meson.build` for managing the build process and dependencies.


## Files
- **[CLI11.hpp.in](CLI11.hpp.in.md)**: The `CLI11.hpp.in` file is a standalone header file template for the CLI11 library, designed to be generated by a script and includes various components and utilities for command-line interface functionality.
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/single-include` directory configures the build process for generating a single-header version of the CLI11 library, including handling Python dependencies and installation options.
- **[meson.build](meson.build.md)**: The `meson.build` file in the `CLI11/single-include` directory configures the build process to generate a single header file `CLI11.hpp` using a Python script, contingent on the `use_single_header` flag.
