The `TimerTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for the `CLI::Timer` and `CLI::AutoTimer` classes, verifying their functionality in measuring and formatting time durations.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of a timer utility within the CLI (Command Line Interface) library. The file uses the Catch2 testing framework to define a series of test cases that assess different aspects of the `CLI::Timer` and `CLI::AutoTimer` classes. The primary focus of these tests is to ensure that the timer correctly measures and formats elapsed time in various units, such as milliseconds, seconds, and nanoseconds. The tests also verify the output format of the timer's string representation, checking for specific substrings that indicate correct functionality.

The file includes several test cases, each targeting a specific feature or behavior of the timer classes. For instance, the "MSTimes" test case checks the timer's ability to measure time in milliseconds and convert it to nanoseconds, while the "BigTimer" test case examines the output format for a larger timer. Some test cases are commented out, indicating potential issues such as long execution times or platform-specific failures (e.g., on Windows). The file is not intended to be an executable on its own but rather serves as a component of a larger test suite, providing narrow functionality focused on ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the timer utilities within the CLI library.
