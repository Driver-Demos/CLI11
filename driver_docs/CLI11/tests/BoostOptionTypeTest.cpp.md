The `BoostOptionTypeTest.cpp` file contains a series of template test cases for validating the integration of various Boost container types with the CLI11 library's option parsing functionality.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the functionality and behavior of various Boost container types when integrated with a command-line interface (CLI) application. The file utilizes the Catch2 testing framework to define multiple template test cases, each focusing on different Boost container types such as `small_vector`, `flat_set`, `stable_vector`, `slist`, and `vector`. These containers are tested in scenarios where they are used to store integers, pairs of integers and strings, tuples, and nested containers. The primary purpose of these tests is to ensure that the containers can correctly handle command-line options and arguments, particularly focusing on the ability to add options, parse arguments, and validate input using the CLI11 library.

The test cases are structured to cover a variety of use cases, including handling single values, pairs, and tuples, as well as nested containers. Each test case sets up a `TApp` object, which represents the CLI application, and adds options that correspond to the Boost containers being tested. The tests then simulate command-line input by setting the `args` attribute of the `TApp` object and executing the `run` method to parse the arguments. Assertions are made to verify the expected size of the containers after parsing, and checks are performed to ensure that validation rules, such as positive number checks, are correctly enforced. This file serves as a robust validation tool for developers to ensure that their CLI applications can effectively utilize Boost containers for argument parsing and validation.
