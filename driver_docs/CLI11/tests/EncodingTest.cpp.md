The `EncodingTest.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase contains unit tests for verifying the functionality of encoding and decoding between different string formats, including UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, as well as testing the conversion of strings to filesystem paths.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is primarily focused on testing the functionality of encoding and decoding between different string representations, specifically UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings. The file includes a series of static constant arrays that represent strings in various languages and symbols, including complex emojis, encoded in different formats. These arrays are used to test the conversion functions `widen` and `narrow` from the CLI namespace, which are responsible for converting between narrow (UTF-8) and wide (UTF-16/UTF-32) string representations. The tests ensure that these conversions are accurate and consistent across different platforms, with specific handling for Windows and non-Windows systems.

Additionally, the file includes conditional compilation for filesystem support, which is used to test the round-trip conversion of strings to filesystem paths using the `to_path` function. This is particularly relevant for ensuring that string encodings are correctly handled when interfacing with the filesystem, which can have different requirements depending on the operating system. The file is structured as a collection of test cases, utilizing the Catch2 testing framework, to validate the correctness of these encoding and decoding operations. The presence of these tests indicates that the file is part of a larger suite aimed at ensuring robust handling of Unicode strings within the CLI11 library, a command-line interface library for C++.

### abcd\_str
- **Type**: `std::string`
- **Description**: The `abcd_str` is a static constant string variable that holds the value "abcd". It is defined at the top level scope, making it a global variable within the file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a simple string literal "abcd" for use in various encoding and decoding operations within the file.


---
### abcd\_wstr
- **Type**: `std::wstring`
- **Description**: The `abcd_wstr` is a global constant wide string variable initialized with the wide character string literal `L"abcd"`. It is defined as a `std::wstring`, which is a wide string type in C++ used to store wide characters, typically for Unicode text.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a wide character representation of the string "abcd" for use in Unicode or wide character operations.


---
### egypt\_utf8\_codeunits
- **Type**: `std::array<uint8_t, 12 + 1>`
- **Description**: The `egypt_utf8_codeunits` is a static constant array of 13 unsigned 8-bit integers, representing the UTF-8 encoded bytes for the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ' repeated three times. Each 'ìÇÄ' character is encoded using four bytes in UTF-8, resulting in a total of 12 bytes, with an additional byte for null-termination.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the UTF-8 byte sequence for the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ' for further conversion or manipulation in the program.


---
### egypt\_str
- **Type**: `std::string`
- **Description**: The `egypt_str` variable is a static constant string that represents a sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters corresponding to the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ' repeated three times. It is initialized by interpreting the byte data from the `egypt_utf8_codeunits` array as a C-style string.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manipulate a UTF-8 encoded string of Egyptian hieroglyphs within the program.


---
### egypt\_utf16\_codeunits
- **Type**: `std::array<uint16_t, 6 + 1>`
- **Description**: The `egypt_utf16_codeunits` is a static constant array of 7 elements of type `uint16_t`, representing UTF-16 encoded code units for the Egyptian hieroglyph character 'ìÇÄ' repeated three times. This array is specifically used in a Windows environment as indicated by the `_WIN32` preprocessor directive.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store UTF-16 encoded data for the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ' to facilitate conversion and comparison operations in Unicode handling.


---
### egypt\_wstr
- **Type**: `std::wstring`
- **Description**: The `egypt_wstr` is a global constant wide string that represents the UTF-32 encoded version of the Egyptian hieroglyphs string "ìÇÄìÇÄìÇÄ". It is constructed by interpreting the UTF-32 code units as wide characters.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manipulate the wide string representation of the Egyptian hieroglyphs for encoding and decoding operations.


---
### egypt\_utf32\_codeunits
- **Type**: `std::array<uint32_t, 3 + 1>`
- **Description**: The `egypt_utf32_codeunits` is a static constant array of 32-bit unsigned integers, specifically designed to store UTF-32 encoded code units representing the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ'. Each element in the array is initialized with the same code point value `0x00013080`, which corresponds to this hieroglyph.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store UTF-32 encoded representations of the Egyptian hieroglyph 'ìÇÄ' for use in Unicode string operations.


---
### hello\_utf8\_codeunits
