The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/tests` directory configures the build and testing environment for the CLI11 library, including setting up dependencies, defining test targets, and handling optional features like Boost and sanitizers.

# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file, which is used to manage the build process of a software project. This file is specifically tailored for a project that utilizes the CLI11 library, a command-line interface library for C++. The configuration includes several key components: it sets up sanitizers for debugging, manages dependencies such as Boost and Catch2, and defines a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the software. The file also includes logic for handling different build environments and configurations, such as single-file tests and multi-file tests, and it sets up custom commands for copying necessary data files for testing. The relevance of this file to the codebase is significant as it orchestrates the compilation, linking, and testing processes, ensuring that the software is built correctly and that all dependencies are properly integrated.
# Content Summary
This CMake configuration file is designed to manage the build and testing process for a software project that utilizes the CLI11 library. The file is structured to handle various dependencies, testing frameworks, and build configurations, ensuring a comprehensive setup for developers working on the project.

Key components of the file include:

1. **Sanitizers Integration**: The file checks for the presence of `CLI11_SANITIZERS` and a compatible CMake version (greater than 3.13.0) to integrate sanitizers from the `arsenm/sanitizers-cmake` repository. This setup is used to enhance code quality by detecting memory errors and undefined behavior during testing.

2. **Boost Library Support**: An option `CLI11_BOOST` is provided to enable testing with the Boost library, specifically for `boost::optional`. The configuration checks for Boost version 1.61 or higher and adjusts the build process accordingly.

3. **Test Suite Configuration**: A comprehensive list of test targets (`CLI11_TESTS`) is defined, covering various aspects of the CLI11 library. Conditional tests are included based on the platform (e.g., `WindowsTest` for Windows) and C++ standard version (e.g., `FuzzFailTest` for C++ standards greater than 16).

4. **Catch2 Testing Framework**: The file attempts to find and configure the Catch2 testing framework. If Catch2 is not found, it downloads the necessary header file. The configuration supports both Catch2 version 2 and 3, with appropriate library setup for each.

5. **Data File Management**: A custom target `cli11_test_data` is created to manage test data files, ensuring they are copied to the appropriate build directory for use during testing.

6. **Single File Test Support**: The configuration includes provisions for building and testing single-file versions of the tests, controlled by the `CLI11_SINGLE_FILE` and `CLI11_SINGLE_FILE_TESTS` options.

7. **Dependent Applications**: The file defines and builds dependent applications (`CLI11_DEPENDENT_APPLICATIONS`) that are used within the test code, ensuring they are correctly linked and included in the test process.

8. **Custom Test Macros**: Macros such as `add_catch_test` and `add_sanitizers` are defined to streamline the process of adding tests and applying sanitizers to test targets.

9. **Coverage and Packaging Tests**: The configuration includes setup for code coverage analysis using `lcov` and tests for package installation and configuration, ensuring the library can be correctly integrated into other projects.

10. **Informational Executable**: An `informational` executable is built and configured to provide runtime information, with its output directory standardized for easy access by CTest.

Overall, this CMake file provides a robust framework for building, testing, and integrating the CLI11 library, with extensive support for dependencies, platform-specific configurations, and testing scenarios.
