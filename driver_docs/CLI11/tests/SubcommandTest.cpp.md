The `SubcommandTest.cpp` file contains a series of test cases for verifying the functionality of subcommands in the CLI11 library, including tests for subcommand creation, aliasing, prefix matching, callback execution, and error handling.

# Purpose
The provided C++ source code file is a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of a command-line interface (CLI) application framework, specifically focusing on subcommand handling. The file utilizes the Catch2 testing framework to define multiple test cases, each encapsulated within `TEST_CASE_METHOD` macros, which leverage a common test fixture `TApp`. This fixture likely sets up a base application environment for each test case to operate within.

The primary focus of these tests is to ensure the correct behavior of subcommands within the CLI application. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic subcommand creation and retrieval, subcommand aliasing, prefix matching, required subcommands, subcommand fallthrough, and error handling for invalid subcommand usage. Additionally, the tests verify the interaction between subcommands and options, including the use of callbacks, exclusion and requirement relationships between subcommands, and the handling of command-line arguments with dot notation for nested subcommands. The file also tests the behavior of subcommands when integrated with option groups and the impact of environment variables on subcommand options. Overall, this file serves as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the CLI framework's subcommand functionality.

# Data Structures

### SubcommandProgram<!-- {{#data_structure:SubcommandProgram}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `start`: A pointer to a CLI::App object representing the 'start' subcommand.
    - `stop`: A pointer to a CLI::App object representing the 'stop' subcommand.
    - `dummy`: An integer variable used as a dummy flag.
    - `file`: A string variable to store the file name option for the 'start' subcommand.
    - `count`: An integer variable used as a flag option for the 'stop' subcommand.
- **Description**: The `SubcommandProgram` struct is a specialized application class derived from `TApp`, designed to handle command-line subcommands using the CLI11 library. It includes two primary subcommands, 'start' and 'stop', each with its own set of options and flags. The 'start' subcommand can take a file name as an option, while the 'stop' subcommand has a count flag. The struct also includes a dummy flag for demonstration purposes. The copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent copying of the struct, ensuring unique instances. The constructor sets up the subcommands and their respective options, and it configures the application to display help for all commands when the `--help-all` flag is used.

**Methods**

---
#### SubcommandProgram::SubcommandProgram<!-- {{#callable:SubcommandProgram::SubcommandProgram}} -->
The `SubcommandProgram` constructor initializes a command-line interface application with two subcommands, 'start' and 'stop', and sets up options and flags for these subcommands.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor sets a help flag for the application using `app.set_help_all_flag("--help-all")`.
    - It adds a subcommand 'start' with a description 'Start prog' and assigns it to the `start` pointer.
    - It adds a subcommand 'stop' with a description 'Stop prog' and assigns it to the `stop` pointer.
    - A flag '-d' is added to the main application, linked to the `dummy` variable, with a description 'My dummy var'.
    - An option '-f,--file' is added to the 'start' subcommand, linked to the `file` variable, with a description 'File name'.
    - A flag '-c,--count' is added to the 'stop' subcommand, linked to the `count` variable, with a description 'Some flag opt'.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the `SubcommandProgram` object with configured subcommands and options.
- **See also**: [`SubcommandProgram`](#subcommandprogram)  (Data Structure)


---
#### SubcommandProgram::operator=<!-- {{#callable:SubcommandProgram::operator=}} -->
The assignment operator for the `SubcommandProgram` struct is deleted to prevent copying of instances.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The assignment operator is explicitly deleted, meaning any attempt to use it will result in a compile-time error.
    - This prevents copying of `SubcommandProgram` instances, ensuring that each instance is unique and not inadvertently duplicated.
- **Output**: There is no output as the function is deleted and cannot be used.
- **See also**: [`SubcommandProgram`](#subcommandprogram)  (Data Structure)


---
#### SubcommandProgram::SubcommandProgram<!-- {{#callable:SubcommandProgram::SubcommandProgram}} -->
The `SubcommandProgram` constructor initializes a command-line interface with subcommands and options using the CLI11 library.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: This constructor does not take any input arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor sets a help flag for all commands using `app.set_help_all_flag("--help-all")`.
    - It adds two subcommands, `start` and `stop`, to the application with descriptions 'Start prog' and 'Stop prog', respectively.
    - A flag `-d` is added to the main application, which modifies the `dummy` variable.
    - An option `-f,--file` is added to the `start` subcommand to specify a file name, modifying the `file` variable.
    - A flag `-c,--count` is added to the `stop` subcommand, modifying the `count` variable.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the `SubcommandProgram` object with configured subcommands and options.

### ManySubcommands<!-- {{#data_structure:ManySubcommands}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `sub1`: Pointer to a CLI::App object representing the first subcommand.
    - `sub2`: Pointer to a CLI::App object representing the second subcommand.
    - `sub3`: Pointer to a CLI::App object representing the third subcommand.
    - `sub4`: Pointer to a CLI::App object representing the fourth subcommand.
- **Description**: The `ManySubcommands` struct is a specialized application class derived from `TApp` that manages multiple subcommands within a command-line interface application. It initializes four subcommands (`sub1`, `sub2`, `sub3`, and `sub4`) and allows for additional arguments to be passed. The struct is designed to handle command-line parsing with multiple subcommands, ensuring that each subcommand can be individually addressed and managed. The copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent copying of the struct, ensuring that each instance maintains its unique set of subcommands.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`ManySubcommands::ManySubcommands`](#manysubcommandsmanysubcommands)
    - [`ManySubcommands::ManySubcommands`](#manysubcommandsmanysubcommands)
    - [`ManySubcommands::operator=`](#manysubcommandsoperator)
- **Inherits From**:
    - [`TApp`](app_helper.hpp.md#tapp)

**Methods**

#### ManySubcommands::ManySubcommands<!-- {{#callable:ManySubcommands::ManySubcommands}} -->
The `ManySubcommands` constructor initializes a command-line application with multiple subcommands and allows extra arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: This constructor does not take any input arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor calls `app.allow_extras()` to enable the application to accept extra arguments.
    - It initializes four subcommand pointers (`sub1`, `sub2`, `sub3`, `sub4`) to `nullptr`.
    - The constructor adds four subcommands ('sub1', 'sub2', 'sub3', 'sub4') to the application using `app.add_subcommand()` and assigns them to the respective pointers.
    - It sets the `args` vector to contain the strings 'sub1', 'sub2', and 'sub3'.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the `ManySubcommands` object with configured subcommands and settings.
