The `ensure_utf8_twice.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase tests the `ensure_utf8` function of the `CLI::App` class by applying it twice to the command-line arguments and verifying their accessibility and integrity.

# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It utilizes the CLI11 library, as seen from the inclusion of `<CLI/CLI.hpp>`, to handle command-line interface functionalities. The program's primary purpose is to ensure that command-line arguments are in UTF-8 format, specifically using the `ensure_utf8` method from the CLI11 library. The code includes platform-specific behavior, with additional checks and operations for Windows systems, such as comparing and modifying command-line arguments. The functionality provided is relatively narrow, focusing on argument processing and validation, particularly for UTF-8 compliance, and it includes a redundant call to `ensure_utf8`, which is noted as unnecessary but harmless.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `cstring`
- `iostream`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a CLI application, ensures UTF-8 encoding of command-line arguments, and performs platform-specific checks on argument accessibility and integrity.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI application with a description.
    - Store the original command-line arguments in `original_argv`.
    - Ensure the command-line arguments are UTF-8 encoded using `app.ensure_utf8(argv)`.
    - On Windows (_WIN32), iterate over each argument to check if it has been modified after UTF-8 conversion, printing and returning an error code if so.
    - On Windows, modify the first character of each argument to ensure accessibility.
    - On non-Windows systems, check if the original and modified argument pointers are the same, returning -1 if they differ.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, a positive integer if a discrepancy is found on Windows, or -1 if a discrepancy is found on non-Windows systems.
