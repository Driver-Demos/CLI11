The `fuzz_app_file_fail28` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test input file for fuzz testing, containing potentially malformed or unexpected command-line arguments.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be binary data, possibly representing a serialized or encoded format. This data is not human-readable and may be used for storing or transmitting information in a compact form within a software system. The repeated sequences and non-standard characters suggest it is not intended for direct interpretation without appropriate decoding or processing.
