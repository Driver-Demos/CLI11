The `fuzz_app_file_fail40` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test configuration file with minimal content.

# Purpose
The file content specifies a configuration setting with the key `config` and an empty string as its value. This likely indicates a placeholder or default configuration that is intended to be customized or filled in later.
