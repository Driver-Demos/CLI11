The `fuzz_app_file_fail37` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test input file for fuzz testing, containing a sequence of non-standard and potentially malformed characters.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be a binary or non-textual data segment, possibly representing encoded or compressed information. It is not directly human-readable and may serve as a configuration or metadata file used by software to store settings or state in a compact, non-plaintext format.
