The `fuzz_app_file_fail22` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test file with unclear or corrupted content, possibly used for fuzz testing purposes.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be non-standard or corrupted data, as it consists of a series of non-printable characters followed by the string "dwrap" and "'a". This does not conform to any known configuration or metadata file format and lacks recognizable structure or key-value pairs typically used for configuration purposes.
