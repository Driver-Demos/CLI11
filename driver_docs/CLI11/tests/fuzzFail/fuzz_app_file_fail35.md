The `fuzz_app_file_fail35` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to contain non-standard or corrupted data, likely used for fuzz testing purposes.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be a sequence of characters that do not conform to any standard metadata or configuration file format. It may represent a form of encoded or obfuscated data, but without additional context, its specific purpose within a software codebase cannot be determined.
