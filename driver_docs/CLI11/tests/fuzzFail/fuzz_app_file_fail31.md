The `fuzz_app_file_fail31` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test input for fuzz testing, containing a sequence of characters and symbols.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be a configuration string or pattern used for setting options or parameters in a software system. The sequence includes delimiters and specific characters that likely represent flags or settings, such as "svopt2" and "-sC", which may correspond to specific operational modes or configurations within the software.
