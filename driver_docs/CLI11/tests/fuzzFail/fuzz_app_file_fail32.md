The `fuzz_app_file_fail32` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test input file for fuzz testing, containing a string with unusual characters.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be corrupted or improperly encoded data, as it contains non-standard characters and lacks a recognizable structure or format typical of configuration or metadata files. It does not conform to any known configuration syntax such as JSON, YAML, or INI.
