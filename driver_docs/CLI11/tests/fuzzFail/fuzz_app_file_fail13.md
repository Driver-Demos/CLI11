The `fuzz_app_file_fail13` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test file located in the `fuzzFail` directory, but it contains no executable code or comments beyond a series of hash symbols.

# Purpose
The file contains a sequence of hash symbols (`#`) and backticks (`'`), which is likely used as a visual separator or comment block within a configuration or metadata file. This type of content is typically used to enhance readability or to delineate sections within a file.
