The `round_trip_custom4` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test case for command-line argument parsing, specifically testing the handling of options like `--vC`, `=-vA`, and `--vopt1=` with a value of `nan`.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be a set of command-line arguments or options, likely used to configure the behavior of a software application or script. The options include `--vC`, `=-vA`, `--vopt1=`, and `nan`, which may correspond to specific flags or parameters that the software recognizes and processes during execution.
