The `fuzz_app_file_fail18` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test case for fuzz testing, containing a sequence of non-printable and special characters.

# Purpose
The file contents appear to be binary or non-textual data, which may represent a compiled or encoded configuration or metadata file. This type of file is typically used for storing settings or information in a format that is not human-readable, possibly for performance or security reasons.
