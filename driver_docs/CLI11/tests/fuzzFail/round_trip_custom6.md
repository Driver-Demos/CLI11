The `round_trip_custom6` file in the `CLI11` codebase appears to be a test case for fuzz testing, containing a malformed or intentionally corrupted command-line input.

# Purpose
The file appears to contain a series of non-standard characters and symbols, which suggests it may be corrupted or not intended for human readability. It does not conform to typical configuration or metadata file formats and lacks discernible structure or key-value pairs.
