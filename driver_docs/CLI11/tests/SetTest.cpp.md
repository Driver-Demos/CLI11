The `SetTest.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase contains a series of test cases for validating the functionality of set and map options in the CLI11 library, including checks for shared pointers, copyable pointers, and various transformations and validations on command-line arguments.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a comprehensive test suite for validating the functionality of a command-line interface (CLI) application, specifically focusing on the handling of options and their transformations using maps and sets. The file includes a series of test cases that utilize the Catch2 testing framework to ensure that various CLI options are correctly parsed, transformed, and validated against predefined sets and maps. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including the use of shared pointers, unique pointers, and different data types such as strings, integers, and enums. The code also tests the ability to handle case-insensitive and underscore-ignoring transformations, as well as the behavior of mutable and non-copyable data structures.

The file is structured to test the CLI's ability to map string inputs to corresponding values using maps, validate inputs against allowed sets, and handle default values and transformations. It includes static assertions to verify type traits related to pointers and pairs, ensuring that the CLI library's internal mechanisms function as expected. The test cases are methodically organized to cover different aspects of option handling, such as default value capture, argument mismatch handling, and validation error throwing. This file serves as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the CLI application's option parsing and validation logic.

# Data Structures

---
### SimpleEnum<!-- {{#data_structure:SimpleEnum}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `SE_one`: Represents the integer value 1.
    - `SE_two`: Represents the integer value 2.
- **Description**: `SimpleEnum` is an enumeration that defines two named integer constants, `SE_one` and `SE_two`, which are assigned the values 1 and 2, respectively. This enum can be used to represent a simple set of named integer values, providing a more readable and maintainable way to handle these specific integer values in the code.


---
### SimpleEnumC<!-- {{#data_structure:SimpleEnumC}} -->
- **Type**: `enum class`
- **Members**:
    - `one`: Represents the integer value 1.
    - `two`: Represents the integer value 2.
- **Description**: `SimpleEnumC` is a scoped enumeration (enum class) in C++ that defines two named constants, `one` and `two`, with integer values 1 and 2, respectively. This enum class provides a type-safe way to work with these specific integer values, ensuring that they are used in a controlled manner within the code.


---
### tstruct<!-- {{#data_structure:tstruct}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `val2`: An integer field in the structure.
    - `val3`: A double precision floating-point field in the structure.
    - `v4`: A string field in the structure.
- **Description**: The `tstruct` is a simple C++ structure that contains three fields: an integer (`val2`), a double (`val3`), and a string (`v4`). This structure is used to store a combination of these three types of data, which can be useful in various applications where such a grouping is needed. The structure is defined multiple times in the provided code, indicating its use in different contexts, particularly in mapping string keys to instances of `tstruct`.
