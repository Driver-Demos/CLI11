The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/tests/find_package_tests` directory sets up a CMake project to test the CLI11 package configuration and target linking by building and running a test executable.

# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to set up a project that tests the integration of the CLI11 library using CMake. It specifies the minimum required version of CMake and defines a project named "CLI11-find-package-test." The file includes the CTest module to enable testing capabilities. It checks if a custom directory for CLI11 is provided and adjusts the CMake prefix path accordingly. The `find_package` command is used to locate the CLI11 library, ensuring that version 2.0 or higher is available. An executable named "package-test" is created from a source file, and it links against the CLI11 library. Finally, a test named "package-test1" is added, which runs the executable with a specific argument and checks the output for a regular expression match to verify correct functionality.
