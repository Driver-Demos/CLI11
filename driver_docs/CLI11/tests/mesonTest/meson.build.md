The `meson.build` file in the `CLI11/tests/mesonTest` directory sets up a C++ project named `mesonTest` with a dependency on `CLI11` and defines an executable target `main` built from `main.cpp`.

# Purpose
This is a Meson build configuration file for a C++ project named "mesonTest". It specifies that the project should use the C++11 standard and includes a dependency on the CLI11 library. The file also defines an executable target named "main", which is built from the source file "main.cpp" and links against the CLI11 dependency.
