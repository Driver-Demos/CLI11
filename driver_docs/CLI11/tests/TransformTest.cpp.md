The `TransformTest.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase contains a series of test cases for validating various transformation functionalities, such as numerical and enum transformations, string escaping, and unit conversions, within the CLI11 library.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of various transformation and validation mechanisms within a command-line interface (CLI) application, likely using the CLI11 library. The file includes numerous test cases that focus on transforming command-line arguments into different data types and formats, such as integers, enums, and strings, using transformers and validators. These transformations include simple mappings, numerical conversions, enum transformations, and more complex operations like handling units of measurement and string escaping.

The tests are organized using the `TEST_CASE_METHOD` macro, which suggests the use of a testing framework like Catch2. Each test case method is associated with a specific transformation scenario, such as "SimpleTransform", "EnumTransform", or "NumberWithUnit". The tests ensure that the transformations are applied correctly and that invalid inputs are handled appropriately, often by throwing exceptions like `CLI::ValidationError` or `CLI::ConversionError`. The file also includes tests for advanced features like cascading transformations, case sensitivity, and handling of special characters in strings. Overall, this file serves as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and correctness of the CLI application's argument parsing and transformation logic.

# Global Variables

---
### validValues
- **Type**: `std::map<std::string, std::string>`
- **Description**: The `validValues` variable is a static constant map that associates specific string keys with their corresponding transformed string values. The keys and values include various Unicode and escape sequences, demonstrating transformations from encoded strings to their decoded or transformed equivalents.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a set of predefined string transformations, likely for testing or validating string transformation functions.


---
### invalidValues
- **Type**: ``std::vector<std::string>``
- **Description**: The `invalidValues` variable is a static constant vector of strings that contains a list of invalid string values. These strings appear to represent malformed Unicode sequences or other invalid string formats.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide a set of invalid string values for testing or validation purposes.


# Data Structures

---
### test\_cli<!-- {{#data_structure:test_cli}} -->
- **Type**: `enum class`
- **Members**:
    - `val1`: Represents the value 3.
    - `val2`: Represents the value 4.
    - `val3`: Represents the value 17.
    - `val4`: Represents the value 37.
- **Description**: The `test_cli` is an enumeration class that defines a set of named integer constants, each associated with a specific `std::int16_t` value. This enum is used to represent a collection of related constants, which can be used for various transformations and mappings within the application, particularly in command-line interface (CLI) transformations. The values are defined as `val1`, `val2`, `val3`, and `val4`, each mapped to a unique integer value.


---
### FooType<!-- {{#data_structure:FooType}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `A`: Represents the first enumerator in the FooType enum.
    - `B`: Represents the second enumerator in the FooType enum.
- **Description**: FooType is an enumeration class that defines two possible values, A and B, using an underlying type of std::uint8_t. This enum is used to represent a simple categorical type with two distinct states, which can be useful in scenarios where a small, fixed set of options is needed.


---
### existing<!-- {{#data_structure:existing}} -->
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `abort`: Represents an action to abort the operation.
    - `overwrite`: Represents an action to overwrite existing data.
    - `remove`: Represents an action to remove existing data.
- **Description**: The `existing` enum class is a strongly-typed enumeration that defines three possible actions to take when dealing with existing data: `abort`, `overwrite`, and `remove`. It is used to specify the behavior of a command-line application when a file already exists in the destination, allowing the user to choose whether to abort the operation, overwrite the existing file, or remove it. This enum is defined with an underlying type of `std::int16_t`, ensuring efficient storage and comparison.
