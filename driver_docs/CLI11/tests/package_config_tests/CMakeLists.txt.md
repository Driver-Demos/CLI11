The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/tests/package_config_tests` directory sets up a CMake project to test the package configuration of CLI11, including finding the package, linking it to an executable, and defining a test with expected output.

# Purpose
The provided file is a CMake configuration script used to set up a test environment for a project named "CLI11-package-config-test." It specifies the minimum required version of CMake and includes the CTest module for testing purposes. The script checks for the presence of the CLI11 library using the PkgConfig module, and if a directory for CLI11 is specified, it adjusts the CMake prefix path accordingly. It then defines an executable target named "package-config-test" that compiles a specific example source file, `positional_validation.cpp`, and links it with the CLI11 library. Finally, it sets up a test named "package-config-test1" to verify the executable's output, ensuring it matches the expected result when run with a specific argument.
