The `OptionGroupTest.cpp` file contains a series of test cases for validating the functionality of option groups within the CLI11 library, including tests for option group creation, validation of required and optional options, handling of invalid option names, and the behavior of nested option groups.

# Purpose
The provided C++ source code file is a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of option groups within a command-line interface (CLI) application. The tests are implemented using the Catch2 testing framework, as indicated by the use of `TEST_CASE_METHOD`. The primary focus of these tests is to ensure the correct behavior of option groups, which are collections of related command-line options that can be managed together. The tests cover various scenarios, including the creation of option groups, the addition of options to these groups, and the enforcement of constraints such as requiring a specific number of options to be set.

The code is structured to test different aspects of option group functionality, such as handling invalid option names, enforcing minimum and maximum constraints on the number of options that can be selected, and ensuring that options are correctly grouped and validated. The tests also explore edge cases, such as attempting to add options that have already been added or belong to different contexts, and they verify that appropriate exceptions are thrown in these cases. Additionally, the code includes tests for more complex scenarios involving nested option groups and subcommands, ensuring that the CLI application behaves as expected when these features are used. Overall, this file serves as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the CLI application's option handling capabilities.

### ManyGroups<!-- {{#data_structure:ManyGroups}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `main`: A pointer to the main option group.
    - `g1`: A pointer to the first option group.
    - `g2`: A pointer to the second option group.
    - `g3`: A pointer to the third option group.
    - `name1`: A string to store the name for the first group.
    - `name2`: A string to store the name for the second group.
    - `name3`: A string to store the name for the third group.
    - `val1`: A string to store a value for the first group.
    - `val2`: A string to store a value for the second group.
    - `val3`: A string to store a value for the third group.
- **Description**: The `ManyGroups` struct is a specialized data structure that extends the `TApp` class to manage multiple option groups within a command-line interface application. It contains pointers to four option groups (`main`, `g1`, `g2`, and `g3`) and six strings to store names and values associated with these groups. The constructor initializes these groups and sets up options for each group, with some options marked as required. The struct also provides a method to remove the 'required' status from these options, allowing for more flexible command-line argument parsing.

**Methods**

---
#### ManyGroups::ManyGroups<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroups::ManyGroups}} -->
The `ManyGroups` constructor initializes a set of option groups within a command-line interface application, each with specific options and requirements.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `main` option group as the outer group using `app.add_option_group` with the name 'main'.
    - It then creates three sub-option groups `g1`, `g2`, and `g3` under the `main` group, each with a specific description.
    - For each sub-group, it adds a required option for a name (`--name1`, `--name2`, `--name3`) and an optional value option (`--val1`, `--val2`, `--val3`).
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the `ManyGroups` object with configured option groups.
- **See also**: [`ManyGroups`](#manygroups)  (Data Structure)


---
#### ManyGroups::operator=<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroups::operator=}} -->
The `operator=` function for the `ManyGroups` class is deleted to prevent assignment operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is explicitly deleted, meaning it cannot be used to assign one `ManyGroups` object to another.
- **Output**: There is no output as the function is deleted and cannot be invoked.
- **See also**: [`ManyGroups`](#manygroups)  (Data Structure)


---
#### ManyGroups::ManyGroups<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroups::ManyGroups}} -->
The `ManyGroups` constructor initializes a set of option groups within a main option group, each containing specific options with some marked as required.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `main` option group by adding it to the `app` with the name 'main' and description 'the main outer group'.
    - Three sub-option groups `g1`, `g2`, and `g3` are added to the `main` group, each with a unique name and description.
    - For each sub-option group, two options are added: a required `--name` option and an optional `--val` option, with the required options being `--name1`, `--name2`, and `--name3`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it initializes the option groups and their options as part of the `ManyGroups` object construction.
- **See also**: [`ManyGroups`](#manygroups)  (Data Structure)


---
#### ManyGroups::remove\_required<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroups::remove_required}} -->
The `remove_required` function sets the 'required' status of specific options and option groups to false, effectively making them optional.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function accesses the option group `g1` and retrieves the option `--name1`, setting its 'required' status to false.
    - Similarly, it accesses option groups `g2` and `g3`, retrieving options `--name2` and `--name3` respectively, and sets their 'required' status to false.
    - Finally, the function sets the 'required' status of the option groups `g1`, `g2`, and `g3` themselves to false.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the state of the options and option groups within the `ManyGroups` structure.
- **See also**: [`ManyGroups`](#manygroups)  (Data Structure)



---
### ManyGroupsPreTrigger<!-- {{#data_structure:ManyGroupsPreTrigger}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `triggerMain`: A size_t variable initialized to 0u, used to store the main trigger count.
    - `trigger1`: A size_t variable initialized to 87u, used to store the trigger count for group 1.
    - `trigger2`: A size_t variable initialized to 34u, used to store the trigger count for group 2.
    - `trigger3`: A size_t variable initialized to 27u, used to store the trigger count for group 3.
- **Description**: The `ManyGroupsPreTrigger` struct is a specialized extension of the `ManyGroups` class, designed to handle pre-parsing callbacks for multiple option groups within an application. It contains four size_t members, each representing a trigger count for different groups, which are updated through pre-parsing callbacks. The constructor initializes these triggers and sets up the callbacks to update the trigger counts based on the number of options parsed in each group, allowing for dynamic response to command-line input.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`ManyGroupsPreTrigger::ManyGroupsPreTrigger`](#manygroupspretriggermanygroupspretrigger)
- **Inherits From**:
    - [`ManyGroups::ManyGroups`](#manygroupsmanygroups)

**Methods**

---
#### ManyGroupsPreTrigger::ManyGroupsPreTrigger<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroupsPreTrigger::ManyGroupsPreTrigger}} -->
The `ManyGroupsPreTrigger` constructor initializes preparse callbacks for the main application and three option groups to update trigger counters based on the number of arguments parsed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor calls `remove_required()` to remove the requirement constraints from the option groups.
    - It sets a preparse callback on the main application (`app`) to update `triggerMain` with the count of parsed arguments.
    - It sets preparse callbacks on three option groups (`g1`, `g2`, `g3`) to update `trigger1`, `trigger2`, and `trigger3` respectively with the count of parsed arguments.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the object state by setting up callbacks.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ManyGroups::remove_required`](#manygroupsremove_required)
- **See also**: [`ManyGroupsPreTrigger`](#manygroupspretrigger)  (Data Structure)



# Functions

---
### ManyGroups<!-- {{#callable:ManyGroups::ManyGroups}} -->
The `ManyGroups` constructor initializes a set of nested option groups within a command-line application, each with specific options and requirements.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `main` option group as the outermost group.
    - Three subgroups `g1`, `g2`, and `g3` are added to the `main` group, each with a description.
    - Each subgroup (`g1`, `g2`, `g3`) is configured with two options: a required `--name` option and an optional `--val` option.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return any value; it sets up the internal state of the `ManyGroups` object with nested option groups and their respective options.
