The `FormatterTest.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase contains a series of test cases for verifying the functionality and customization options of the CLI11 library's formatter, including tests for help message formatting, option customization, subcommand handling, and description and footer formatting.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test suite for the CLI11 library, specifically focusing on the customization and formatting of command-line interface (CLI) help messages. The file includes a series of test cases using the Catch2 testing framework to verify the behavior of different formatter configurations within the CLI11 library. The primary functionality being tested is the ability to customize the help output of a CLI application, including setting custom labels, column widths, and handling subcommands. The tests cover various scenarios such as using a simple formatter, customizing option text, handling flags, and managing subcommands, ensuring that the help output meets the expected format and content.

The code is structured to test the integration of custom formatters with the CLI11 library, demonstrating how users can modify the default help message to suit their application's needs. The tests validate that the customizations are correctly applied and that the resulting help messages contain the expected elements, such as required labels, option descriptions, and subcommand listings. This file serves as a comprehensive validation tool for developers using the CLI11 library to ensure that their CLI applications provide clear and correctly formatted help messages to end-users.

# Data Structures

---
### SimpleFormatter<!-- {{#data_structure:SimpleFormatter}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Description**: The `SimpleFormatter` class is a derived class from `CLI::FormatterBase` that provides a simple implementation of the `make_help` method, which returns a fixed string "This is really simple". This class is used to format help messages in a straightforward manner without any additional customization or complexity.
- **Member Functions**:
    - [`SimpleFormatter::SimpleFormatter`](#simpleformattersimpleformatter)
    - [`SimpleFormatter::make_help`](#simpleformattermake_help)
- **Inherits From**:
    - `CLI::FormatterBase`

**Methods**

---
#### SimpleFormatter::SimpleFormatter<!-- {{#callable:SimpleFormatter::SimpleFormatter}} -->
The `SimpleFormatter` constructor initializes a `SimpleFormatter` object by calling the base class `FormatterBase` constructor.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor `SimpleFormatter()` is defined, which calls the constructor of its base class `FormatterBase`.
- **Output**: An instance of `SimpleFormatter` is created, which is a subclass of `CLI::FormatterBase`.
- **See also**: [`SimpleFormatter`](#simpleformatter)  (Data Structure)


---
#### SimpleFormatter::make\_help<!-- {{#callable:SimpleFormatter::make_help}} -->
The `make_help` function in the `SimpleFormatter` class returns a fixed string "This is really simple" as the help message.
- **Inputs**:
    - `CLI::App *`: A pointer to a `CLI::App` object, representing the application for which help is being generated.
    - `std::string`: A string parameter, possibly representing additional context or options for formatting the help message.
    - `CLI::AppFormatMode`: An enumeration value indicating the format mode for the help message.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes three parameters: a pointer to a `CLI::App` object, a string, and a `CLI::AppFormatMode` enumeration.
    - It immediately returns the string "This is really simple" without using any of the input parameters.
- **Output**: A `std::string` containing the fixed message "This is really simple".
