The `SimpleTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for the CLI11 library, specifically testing basic parsing functionality and error handling with empty and non-empty input.

# Purpose
This C++ code is a test file that utilizes the Catch2 testing framework to verify the behavior of the CLI11 library, which is a command-line interface parser. The code provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on testing the parsing capabilities of the CLI11 library when handling empty and non-empty input scenarios. It includes conditional compilation to support both single-file and multi-file inclusion of the CLI11 library, indicating flexibility in how the library can be integrated. The test cases check for expected behavior, such as successful parsing of empty input and throwing an exception when unexpected input is encountered. This file is intended to be part of a test suite rather than an executable or a library to be imported elsewhere.
