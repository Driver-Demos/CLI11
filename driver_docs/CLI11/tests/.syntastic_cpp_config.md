The `.syntastic_cpp_config` file in the `CLI11` codebase specifies include paths for the Syntastic plugin to use with Google Test and Google Mock headers.

# Purpose
The provided content specifies include directories for a build process, likely for a C++ project using Google Test and Google Mock. The `-I` flags indicate paths to the directories where the header files for Google Test and Google Mock are located, ensuring that the compiler can find and use these headers during the build.
