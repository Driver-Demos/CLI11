The `link_test_1.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase includes headers for CLI and Timer functionalities and defines a simple function `do_nothing` that returns the integer 7.

# Purpose
This C++ code snippet appears to be part of a larger project, likely a library or utility, given the inclusion of headers from the "CLI" namespace, which suggests it is related to command-line interface functionality. The code itself is minimal, containing only a single function, `do_nothing()`, which returns the integer 7. This function provides very narrow functionality, as it does not perform any operations or calculations beyond returning a constant value. The presence of copyright and licensing information indicates that this code is intended for distribution and use under the specified BSD-3-Clause license, but the snippet itself is not an executable; rather, it is likely a small component of a larger codebase, possibly used for testing or as a placeholder.
