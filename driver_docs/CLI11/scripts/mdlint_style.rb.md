The `mdlint_style.rb` file configures markdown linting rules by excluding certain rules and setting specific styles for others, such as trailing punctuation in headers and ordered list styles.

# Purpose
The file is a configuration for a Markdown linter, specifying rules to be excluded and customized. It disables checks for line length, inline HTML, and bare URLs, while configuring rules for trailing punctuation in headers, ordered list styles, and list indentation levels.
