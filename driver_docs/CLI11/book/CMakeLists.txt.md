The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/book` directory configures a custom build target named `cli_book` that includes markdown files from the book's README, summary, and chapters.

# Purpose
The file is a CMake configuration script that defines a custom build target named `cli_book`. It specifies `README.md` and `SUMMARY.md` as source files and uses the `file(GLOB ...)` command to include all Markdown files located in the `chapters` directory relative to the current source directory. This setup is used to manage and build documentation or a book-like structure from these Markdown files.
