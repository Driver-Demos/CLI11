The `code` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains example C++ files and a CMake configuration file that demonstrate the usage of the CLI11 library for building command-line applications with various features such as flag parsing and basic command emulation.


## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase sets up a CMake project for CLI11 examples, defining imported interface targets, adding executables, and configuring tests for various example programs.
- **[flags.cpp](flags.cpp.md)**: The `flags.cpp` file demonstrates how to use the CLI11 library to define and parse boolean, integer, and plain flags in a command-line application.
- **[geet.cpp](geet.cpp.md)**: The `geet.cpp` file implements a command-line application named "Geet" that mimics git commands for adding and committing files, but does not perform any actual operations.
- **[intro.cpp](intro.cpp.md)**: The `intro.cpp` file demonstrates a basic command-line application using the CLI11 library to parse an integer parameter from the command line.
- **[simplest.cpp](simplest.cpp.md)**: The `simplest.cpp` file demonstrates a basic setup for a command-line interface application using the CLI11 library.
