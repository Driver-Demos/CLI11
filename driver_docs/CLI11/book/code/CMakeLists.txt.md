The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase sets up a CMake project for CLI11 examples, defining imported interface targets, adding executables, and configuring tests for various example programs.

# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration file used to set up a project named "CLI11_Examples" that utilizes the C++ programming language. It specifies a minimum required version of CMake between 3.11 and 3.31 and defines an imported interface library target named `CLI11::CLI11`, which includes the necessary header files and C++ standard features. The file also enables testing with CTest and defines a function `add_cli_exe` to streamline the creation of executable targets from C++ source files. These executables are then linked with the `CLI11::CLI11` library, and several test cases are added for each executable to verify their functionality using CTest, ensuring that the command-line interface examples work as expected.
