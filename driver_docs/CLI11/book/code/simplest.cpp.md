The `simplest.cpp` file demonstrates a basic setup for a command-line interface application using the CLI11 library.

# Purpose
This code is a simple C++ executable that utilizes the CLI11 library to create a command-line interface application. It provides narrow functionality as a template or starting point for building command-line tools by allowing the user to define options and flags that can be parsed from the command line. The code includes the main function, which is the entry point of the program, and it initializes a `CLI::App` object from the CLI11 library. The `CLI11_PARSE` macro is used to parse the command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`) based on the options and flags that would be added to the `app` object. This code is intended to be expanded with specific command-line options and flags to suit the needs of a particular application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a CLI application and parses command-line arguments using the CLI11 library.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the actual command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object named `app`.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using the `CLI11_PARSE` macro with `app`, `argc`, and `argv`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
