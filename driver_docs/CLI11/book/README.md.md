The `README.md` file in the `CLI11/book` directory provides an introduction to the CLI11 library, detailing its features, usage, and integration methods for creating command line programs in C++.

# Purpose
The provided content is from a GitBook documentation file that serves as an introduction to the CLI11 library, which is used for creating command-line interface (CLI) programs in C++. This file is not a configuration file but rather a comprehensive guide aimed at developers who wish to integrate CLI11 into their applications. It offers a broad overview of the library's capabilities, including its simplicity, cross-platform support, and extensive features such as handling options, subcommands, and configuration files. The document is structured to provide both a high-level understanding and practical examples, demonstrating how to implement basic to complex command-line applications using CLI11. This documentation is crucial for developers in a codebase as it provides the necessary information to effectively utilize the CLI11 library, ensuring that they can leverage its full potential in their software projects.
# Content Summary
The provided content is an introduction to the CLI11 library, a C++ library designed for creating command-line interfaces. CLI11 is noted for its simplicity, power, and ease of use, requiring only C++11 support without the need for `<regex>`. It is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows, boasting 100% test coverage across these platforms. The library can be easily integrated into applications by including a single header file (`CLI11.hpp`), with additional integration methods detailed in the library's README.

CLI11 draws inspiration from Python libraries like Plumbum and Click, incorporating user-friendly features from these libraries. It is well-documented, offering a tutorial book, a friendly introduction, and comprehensive API documentation. The library's syntax is scalable, suitable for both simple applications and complex projects with numerous parameters and switches. It provides built-in help functionality and handles incorrect arguments gracefully.

The library supports a wide range of features, including positional arguments, flags, repeating options, interdependent options, custom validators, and help groups. It also allows for the use of subcommands, which can be nested infinitely and support callback lambda functions. CLI11 can read and produce `.ini` files for configuration and utilize environment variables as input. The base `App` class can be subclassed and customized, making it versatile for various applications.

CLI11 was developed at the University of Cincinnati to support the GooFit library, under NSF Award 1414736, and has been featured in a DIANA/HEP meeting at CERN. The library encourages user feedback and contributions to its documentation.
