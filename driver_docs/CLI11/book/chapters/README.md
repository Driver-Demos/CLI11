The `chapters` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains comprehensive documentation files that cover various aspects of using the CLI11 library, including installation, basic and advanced usage, configuration, flags, options, subcommands, formatting, internals, toolkits, and validators.


## Files
- **[advanced-topics.md](advanced-topics.md.md)**: The `advanced-topics.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides detailed explanations and examples of advanced features in CLI11, including environment variables, needs/excludes for flags, custom option callbacks, and custom converters for handling various data types.
- **[an-advanced-example.md](an-advanced-example.md.md)**: The `an-advanced-example.md` file provides a step-by-step guide to creating a simple `git` clone demonstration called `geet` using CLI11, including defining subcommands and compiling the code.
- **[basics.md](basics.md.md)**: The `basics.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides an introduction to creating a simple command-line interface application using the CLI11 library, including the setup of a `CLI::App` object and parsing command line arguments.
- **[config.md](config.md.md)**: The `config.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides comprehensive documentation on how to handle configuration files within the CLI11 library, including reading, writing, and customizing configuration files in various formats such as TOML and INI, as well as managing multiple configuration files and triggering subcommands.
- **[flags.md](flags.md.md)**: The `flags.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive guide on adding various types of flags to a command line program using the CLI11 library, including boolean, integer, arbitrary type, pure, and callback flags, as well as handling aliases and case-insensitivity.
- **[formatting.md](formatting.md.md)**: The `formatting.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides guidance on customizing and subclassing formatters to control the help output of CLI applications, including setting column widths and labels, and understanding the structure of help messages.
- **[installation.md](installation.md.md)**: The `installation.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides detailed instructions on how to install and integrate the CLI11 library into a project using various methods, including single file and full edition setups, CMake, Meson, vcpkg, and Conan, along with special instructions for specific compilers and platforms.
- **[internals.md](internals.md.md)**: The `internals.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides an overview of the internal workings of the library, including how it uses callbacks with lambda functions to bind to variables, the detailed parsing procedure, and the handling of exceptions.
- **[options.md](options.md.md)**: The `options.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides comprehensive documentation on how to add and configure command line options using the CLI11 library, detailing various types of options, positional options, containers of options, option modifiers, and customization techniques for handling multiple option calls and parsing configurations.
- **[subcommands.md](subcommands.md.md)**: The `subcommands.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive guide on implementing and managing subcommands within a C++ application, including features like required subcommands, callbacks, inheritance of defaults, and special modes such as fallthrough and prefix commands.
- **[toolkits.md](toolkits.md.md)**: The `toolkits.md` file provides guidance on integrating CLI11 into a toolkit, including using custom namespaces, subclassing the `App` class, and utilizing virtual functions.
- **[validators.md](validators.md.md)**: The `validators.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides detailed documentation on the two types of validators—`transform` and `check`—used for input validation, including examples, built-in validators, and guidelines for creating custom validators.
