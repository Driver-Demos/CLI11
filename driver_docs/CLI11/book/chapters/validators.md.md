The `validators.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides detailed documentation on the two types of validators—`transform` and `check`—used for input validation, including examples, built-in validators, and guidelines for creating custom validators.

# Purpose
This file is a documentation snippet for configuring validators in the CLI11 library, a C++ command line interface framework. It provides detailed instructions on how to implement and use two types of validators: `transform` validators, which are mutating, and `check` validators, which are non-mutating. The file explains the function signatures required for each type of validator and provides examples of how to create custom validators, such as a `LowerCaseValidator`. It also lists built-in validators available in CLI11, such as `ExistingFile` and `Range`, and describes the protected members that can be set when creating custom validators. This documentation is crucial for developers using CLI11 to ensure that command-line inputs are validated correctly, enhancing the robustness and reliability of applications that rely on user input.
# Content Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of validators used in the CLI11 library, which are essential for input validation in command-line applications. Validators in CLI11 are categorized into two main types: `transform` validators and `check` validators. 

**Transform Validators** are mutating functions with the signature `std::string(std::string&)`. They modify the input string and return an error message if the input is invalid, or an empty string if it is valid. If an error occurs, they should throw a `CLI::ValidationError`. An example provided demonstrates a transform validator that changes the input string to "new string" unless it encounters specific error conditions.

**Check Validators** are non-mutating and recommended unless mutation is necessary. They can be implemented as a simple function with the signature `std::string(const std::string&)` or as a subclass of `struct CLI::Validator`. The `CLI::Validator` structure requires setting two members: `func_`, the core validation function, and `name_`, the type name for the option. Check validators can be combined using `&` and `|` operators and can be invoked like functions. CLI11 provides const static versions of validators to simplify usage.

The document also lists built-in validators in CLI11, such as `ExistingFile`, `ExistingDirectory`, `ExistingPath`, `NonexistentPath`, and `Range(min=0, max)`, each serving specific validation purposes like checking for file existence or ensuring a value falls within a specified range.

For custom validators, the document outlines protected members that can be set, including `func_` for the core validation logic, `desc_function` for optional descriptions, `name_` for search purposes, `application_index_` to specify the element the validator applies to, `active_` to enable or disable the validator, and `non_modifying_` to distinguish between a Validator and a Transformer.

Overall, this document serves as a detailed guide for developers to implement and utilize validators effectively within the CLI11 framework, ensuring robust input validation in their command-line applications.
