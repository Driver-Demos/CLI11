The `an-advanced-example.md` file provides a step-by-step guide to creating a simple `git` clone demonstration called `geet` using CLI11, including defining subcommands and compiling the code.

# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a section from a documentation file, likely part of a tutorial or guide, explaining how to create a simple command-line application using C++ that mimics the behavior of the `git` command, named `geet`. The document outlines the process of setting up the application with subcommands such as `add` and `commit`, and includes code snippets from a source file (`geet.cpp`) to demonstrate each step. It emphasizes the use of subcommands and options, and suggests improvements for organizing the code by splitting it into multiple files, enhancing maintainability and readability. Additionally, it provides a compilation command and references to further examples and source code, facilitating a deeper understanding and practical application for users interested in building similar command-line tools.
