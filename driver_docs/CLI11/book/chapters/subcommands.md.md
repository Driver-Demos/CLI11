The `subcommands.md` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive guide on implementing and managing subcommands within a C++ application, including features like required subcommands, callbacks, inheritance of defaults, and special modes such as fallthrough and prefix commands.

# Purpose
The provided content appears to be documentation for a C++ command-line interface (CLI) library, specifically focusing on the implementation and management of subcommands within an application. This file serves a narrow purpose, detailing how to configure and utilize subcommands in a CLI application, which is a common pattern in command-line tools like `git`. The documentation covers various aspects of subcommand management, including adding subcommands, setting required subcommand counts, using callbacks, and handling special modes such as fallthrough and prefix commands. It also discusses inheritance of defaults and validation of positional and optional arguments. This file is crucial for developers using the library to understand how to structure their CLI applications effectively, ensuring they can leverage the full capabilities of subcommands to create robust and user-friendly command-line tools.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a detailed guide on implementing subcommands within a C++ application using a command-line interface library, likely CLI11. The document outlines the structure and functionality of subcommands, which are specialized commands that extend the capabilities of a main application command, similar to how `git` uses subcommands like `add` and `commit`.

### Key Functional Details:

1. **Parent App Configuration**: The document begins by discussing the parent `App`, which is the main application object. Developers can customize the help output, set footers, and define custom failure messages. This customization is achieved through methods like `app.footer()` and `app.failure_message()`.

2. **Adding Subcommands**: Subcommands are added to the main application using `app.add_subcommand()`, which requires a name and a description. The subcommand is stored internally, and developers can capture its pointer for later use. The document provides multiple methods to check if a subcommand was invoked, such as `if(*sub)` and `if(app.got_subcommand("sub"))`.

3. **Subcommand Options and Nesting**: Subcommands inherit the same options as the main app, allowing for infinite nesting. This means subcommands can have their own subcommands, each with its own set of options.

4. **Required Subcommands**: The number of subcommands expected can be controlled using `app.require_subcommand()`. This method can set a minimum and maximum number of subcommands, with special behavior when the maximum is set to zero, allowing unlimited subcommands.

5. **Callbacks**: Developers can define callbacks using lambda functions to execute specific code when a subcommand is invoked. This approach is preferred over procedural code execution after parsing.

6. **Inheritance of Defaults**: When a subcommand is created, it inherits several default settings from the parent app, such as help flag descriptions, footers, failure message functions, and more.

7. **Special Modes**: The document describes several special modes:
   - **Allow Extras**: Allows extra command-line arguments to be stored rather than causing an error.
   - **Fallthrough**: Enables options not matched in a subcommand to be passed to the parent command.
   - **Prefix Command**: Stops parsing at unknown options, similar to Git's behavior.
   - **Prefix Matching**: Allows subcommands to be matched by unambiguous prefixes.
   - **Silent Subcommands**: Subcommands can be hidden from the list, useful for modifiers like help commands.
   - **Positional and Optional Argument Validation**: Ensures arguments are applied correctly to positional or optional options based on validators.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of managing subcommands within a C++ application, offering developers flexibility in command-line interface design and execution.
