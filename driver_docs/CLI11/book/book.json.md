The `book.json` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides metadata and configuration for a tutorial book on CLI11, including details about the author, plugins, and plugin configurations.

# Purpose
This JSON file is a configuration for a documentation generator, specifying metadata for a tutorial titled "CLI11 Tutorial" authored by Henry Schreiner. It includes a description and lists plugins such as "include-codeblock," "term," and "hints," with specific configuration options for the "include-codeblock" plugin to unindent and fix language in code blocks.
