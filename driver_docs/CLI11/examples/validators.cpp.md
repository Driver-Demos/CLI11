The `validators.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase demonstrates how to use the CLI11 library to create a command-line application with options that include file existence and range validation.

# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program designed to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library, providing narrow functionality specific to validating user input. The program sets up a command-line application named "Validator checker" that accepts two options: a file name and a numerical value. The file name must correspond to an existing file, and the numerical value must be within the range of 3 to 6, as enforced by the CLI11 library's validation checks. The code is structured to be run as a standalone application, indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it outputs a simple message to the console, suggesting further interaction with the command-line interface.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `iostream`
- `string`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application that checks for a valid file and a value within a specified range, then outputs a message.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object named 'app' with the description 'Validator checker'.
    - Declare a string variable 'file' to store the file name provided by the user.
    - Add an option to the app for the file name with flags '-f', '--file', and 'file', and set a validator to check if the file exists.
    - Declare an integer variable 'count' initialized to 0 to store a value provided by the user.
    - Add an option to the app for the value with flags '-v' and '--value', and set a validator to ensure the value is within the range 3 to 6.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using CLI11_PARSE macro, which processes the options and arguments.
    - Output a message to the console: 'Try printing help or failing the validator'.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
