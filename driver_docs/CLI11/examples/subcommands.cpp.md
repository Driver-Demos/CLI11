The `subcommands.cpp` file demonstrates the use of the CLI11 library to create a command-line application with subcommands and options, including "start" and "stop" subcommands with associated flags and options.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program that utilizes the CLI11 library to create a command-line interface for a tool named "K3Pi goofit fitter." The primary purpose of this code is to define and manage command-line options and subcommands for the application. The code sets up a main application with a help flag and a random flag, and it defines two subcommands: "start" and "stop." The "start" subcommand includes an option to specify a file name, while the "stop" subcommand includes a flag for counting occurrences. The program requires at least one subcommand to be executed, ensuring that users provide necessary input for the application's operation.

The code is structured to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library, which simplifies the process of handling complex command-line interfaces. The main technical components include the creation of the `CLI::App` object, the addition of flags and options, and the parsing of command-line arguments with `CLI11_PARSE`. The program outputs information about the provided options and flags, such as the file name from the "start" subcommand and the count of the "stop" subcommand's flag. This code is designed to be executed directly and does not define public APIs or external interfaces, focusing instead on providing a user-friendly command-line experience for the specific application it supports.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `iostream`
- `string`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application with subcommands and options, parses the input arguments, and outputs the results of the parsed options and subcommands.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the actual command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object named 'app' with a description 'K3Pi goofit fitter'.
    - Set a help flag '--help-all' to expand all help messages.
    - Add a flag '--random' to the app for some unspecified purpose.
    - Create a subcommand 'start' with a description and add it to the app.
    - Create another subcommand 'stop' with a description and add it to the app.
    - Require at least one subcommand to be specified by the user.
    - Add an option '-f,--file' to the 'start' subcommand to accept a file name.
    - Add a flag '-c,--count' to the 'stop' subcommand to act as a counter.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using CLI11_PARSE macro.
    - Output the value of the file option if the 'start' subcommand is used.
    - Output the count of the '--count' flag if the 'stop' subcommand is used, using two different methods to retrieve the count.
    - Output the count of the '--random' flag if it is used.
    - Iterate over all subcommands and output their names.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution.
