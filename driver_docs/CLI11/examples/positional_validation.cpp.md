The `positional_validation.cpp` file is an example program using the CLI11 library to demonstrate positional argument validation for numbers and file inputs.

# Purpose
This C++ code is an executable program designed to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library, which provides a robust framework for handling command-line interfaces. The program specifically focuses on validating and processing positional arguments, offering narrow functionality tailored to a specific use case. It requires the user to input two numbers and two file names, with the first file being mandatory and the second optional. The code checks that the numbers are valid integers and ensures that the required file argument is provided, then outputs the parsed values to the console. This code is likely used for testing or demonstrating the capabilities of the CLI11 library in handling positional argument validation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `iostream`
- `string`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function sets up a command-line interface to parse and validate positional arguments for two numbers and two file names, then outputs the parsed values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object with a description for positional validation.
    - Declare integer variables `num1` and `num2` initialized to -1, and add them as options to the CLI app with number validation.
    - Declare string variables `file1` and `file2`, and add them as options to the CLI app, marking `file1` as required.
    - Call `validate_positionals()` to ensure positional arguments are correctly validated.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using `CLI11_PARSE`.
    - Check if `num1` is not -1 and print its value if true.
    - Check if `num2` is not -1 and print its value if true.
    - Print the value of `file1`.
    - Check if `file2` is not empty and print its value if true.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution.
