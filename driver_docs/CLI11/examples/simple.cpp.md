The `simple.cpp` file is an example program using the CLI11 library to parse command-line options and flags, including file name, count, flag, and a double value, and then outputs the parsed results.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library. The primary purpose of the code is to facilitate the configuration and execution of a program named "K3Pi goofit fitter" by allowing users to specify various options and flags when running the program from the command line. The code defines several command-line options, including a file name, a counter, a flag that can be passed multiple times, and a double value. These options are parsed and processed using the CLI11 library, which simplifies the handling of command-line arguments.

The code is structured around the [`main`](#main) function, which is the entry point of the program. It utilizes the CLI11 library to define and manage command-line options, demonstrating the use of options (`-f`, `-c`, `-d`) and flags (`--flag`). The program outputs the values of these options and flags to the console, providing feedback on the input received from the user. This file is not a library or a header file intended for reuse in other programs; rather, it is a standalone executable that leverages the CLI11 library to offer a user-friendly interface for configuring and running the "K3Pi goofit fitter" application.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `CLI/CLI.hpp`
- `iostream`
- `string`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application using the CLI11 library, parses command-line arguments, and outputs the parsed values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::App object with the description 'K3Pi goofit fitter'.
    - Set a version flag for the application using the CLI11 version.
    - Declare a string variable `file` and add a command-line option for it with flags '-f', '--file', and 'file'.
    - Declare an integer `count` initialized to 0 and add a command-line option for it with flags '-c' and '--count'.
    - Declare an integer `v` initialized to 0 and add a command-line flag '--flag' that can be passed multiple times.
    - Declare a double `value` initialized to 0.0 and add a command-line option for it with flags '-d' and '--double'.
    - Parse the command-line arguments using `CLI11_PARSE`.
    - Output the parsed values for `file`, `count`, `v`, and `value` using `std::cout`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
