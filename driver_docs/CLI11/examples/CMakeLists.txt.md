The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/examples` directory defines functions and configurations for building and testing various example executables using the CLI11 library, including setting up dependencies, linking libraries, and specifying test properties.

# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake script, which is a configuration file used to automate the build process of software projects. This script is specifically designed to define and manage the build and testing of various command-line interface (CLI) applications using the CMake build system. It includes functions to add executable targets (`add_cli_exe`) and link them with necessary libraries, such as `CLI11` and `nlohmann/json`. The script also sets up a comprehensive suite of tests for these executables using CMake's `add_test` and `set_property` commands, ensuring that each CLI application behaves as expected under different scenarios. The file's content is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the codebase by automating the compilation and testing processes, thus facilitating continuous integration and development workflows.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a CMake script designed to manage the build and testing of various command-line interface (CLI) applications using the CLI11 library. The script defines a function `add_cli_exe` to streamline the creation of executable targets, linking them with the CLI11 library, and optionally setting specific properties such as using the `libc++` standard library if `CLI11_FORCE_LIBCXX` is enabled.

The script conditionally includes the nlohmann/json library if `CLI11_BUILD_EXAMPLES_JSON` is set, fetching it from a specified URL and ensuring it is populated before use. It then defines a series of CLI applications, each with associated tests to verify their functionality. These applications include:

1. **json**: Tests JSON configuration input and output.
2. **simple**: Tests basic command-line options and flags.
3. **subcommands**: Tests the handling of subcommands and their required arguments.
4. **subcom_partitioned**: Tests partitioned subcommands and their help output.
5. **config_app**: Tests configuration file handling with different file paths.
6. **option_groups**: Tests mutually exclusive option groups.
7. **positional_arity** and **positional_validation**: Test positional argument handling and validation.
8. **shapes**: Tests geometric shape processing.
9. **ranges**: Tests range and min-max argument handling.
10. **validators**: Tests input validation for file existence and value ranges.
11. **groups**: Tests grouped command-line options.
12. **inter_argument_order**: Tests the order of interdependent arguments.
13. **prefix_command**: Tests command prefix handling.
14. **arg_capture**: Tests argument capturing and processing.
15. **callback_passthrough**: Tests callback functions with arguments.
16. **enum** and **enum_ostream**: Test enumeration handling and output.
17. **digit_args**: Tests digit-based arguments.
18. **modhelp**: Tests modified help output.
19. **array_option**: Tests array-style options.
20. **subcom_in_files**: Tests subcommands with file input.
21. **formatter** and **nested**: Placeholder for additional executables.
22. **subcom_help**: Tests help output for subcommands.
23. **retired**: Tests deprecated and retired options with warnings.
24. **close_match**: Tests close match suggestions for command-line inputs.
25. **custom_parse**: Tests custom parsing logic.
26. **help_usage**: Tests help usage output.

Each test is configured with expected output patterns using regular expressions to validate the correct behavior of the CLI applications. The script also includes conditional logic to add certain executables based on the C++ standard version, ensuring compatibility and feature availability.
