The `subcom_partitioned.cpp` file is an example program using the CLI11 library to create a command-line application with subcommands for handling file input and counting, as well as an optional double value.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library. The primary purpose of the code is to set up a command-line interface for a program named "K3Pi goofit fitter." The code defines a main function that initializes a CLI::App object, which represents the main application, and two subcommands, "Important" and "Other," each with their own options. The "Important" subcommand requires a file name and a count flag, while the "Other" subcommand optionally accepts a double value. The program uses CLI11's parsing capabilities to handle user input and provides feedback on the parsed options, such as the file name, count, and value, through standard output.

The code leverages several key components of the CLI11 library, such as CLI::App for application and subcommand management, CLI::Option for defining command-line options, and CLI::AutoTimer for timing operations. The use of shared pointers (std::make_shared<CLI::App>) for subcommands indicates a modular approach to command-line option management. The program also includes error handling for parsing errors, ensuring robust command-line argument processing. This file is a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of the main function, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces beyond the command-line interface it provides.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application with subcommands and options, parses the input arguments, and outputs the parsed values and counts.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a CLI::AutoTimer object to measure execution time.
    - Create a main CLI::App object named 'K3Pi goofit fitter'.
    - Create a subcommand 'Important' with a required file option and a required count flag.
    - Create another subcommand 'Other' with an optional double value option.
    - Add the subcommands to the main application.
    - Attempt to parse the command-line arguments using the app object.
    - Catch any CLI::ParseError exceptions and exit the application with the error code if parsing fails.
    - Output the parsed file name, count, and value along with their respective counts.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer 0 to indicate successful execution, or an error code if parsing fails.
