The `groups.cpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase demonstrates the use of the CLI11 library to create a command-line application with grouped options, including required file and count options, and an optional double value.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to parse command-line arguments using the CLI11 library. The primary purpose of the program is to facilitate the configuration and execution of a fitting process, as suggested by the application name "K3Pi goofit fitter." The code utilizes the CLI11 library to define and manage command-line options, including a required file name and a counter flag, both grouped under "Important," and an optional double value under "Other." The program ensures that the required options are provided by the user, and it handles parsing errors gracefully by catching exceptions and exiting with an appropriate status code.

The code is structured around the [`main`](#main) function, which is typical for an executable program. It includes the use of `CLI::AutoTimer` to measure the execution time of the program, although the timer's specific purpose is not detailed in the code. The program outputs the parsed values and counts of the command-line options, providing feedback to the user about the input received. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as its primary function is to serve as a standalone application for command-line interaction.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application to parse and handle command-line arguments for file name, count, and a double value, and then outputs the parsed values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a timer named 'give_me_a_name' to measure the execution time of the program.
    - Create a CLI application named 'K3Pi goofit fitter'.
    - Add a required option for file name with flags '-f', '--file', and 'file', and group it under 'Important'.
    - Add a required flag for count with flags '-c' and '--count', and group it under 'Important'.
    - Add an optional double value option with flags '-d' and '--double', and group it under 'Other'.
    - Attempt to parse the command-line arguments using the `app.parse` method.
    - If a `CLI::ParseError` is caught, exit the program with the error code returned by `app.exit(e)`.
    - Output the parsed file name, count, and double value to the console.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, 0, indicating successful execution.
