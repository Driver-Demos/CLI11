The `subcom_in_files` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains source files and a CMake configuration for building a command-line interface application with subcommands using the CLI11 library.


## Files
- **[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt.md)**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11/examples/subcom_in_files` directory configures the build system to create an executable named `subcommand_main` from the source files `subcommand_main.cpp`, `subcommand_a.cpp`, and `subcommand_a.hpp`.
- **[subcommand_a.cpp](subcommand_a.cpp.md)**: The `subcommand_a.cpp` file sets up and implements a subcommand for a command-line interface, allowing options to be specified and executed using a shared pointer to manage option data.
- **[subcommand_a.hpp](subcommand_a.hpp.md)**: The `subcommand_a.hpp` file defines the structure and functions necessary to set up and execute Subcommand A within the CLI11 framework, including options for file handling and a boolean flag.
- **[subcommand_main.cpp](subcommand_main.cpp.md)**: The `subcommand_main.cpp` file demonstrates setting up a command-line interface application using the CLI11 library, including the requirement of at least one subcommand.
