The `subcommand_a.cpp` file sets up and implements a subcommand for a command-line interface, allowing options to be specified and executed using a shared pointer to manage option data.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is designed to set up and execute a specific subcommand within a command-line interface (CLI) application. The primary functionality of this file is to define and configure a subcommand named "subcommand_a" using the CLI11 library, which is a popular library for creating command-line interfaces in C++. The file includes the necessary headers and utilizes a shared pointer to manage the options associated with the subcommand, ensuring that the options' memory addresses remain valid for binding purposes. The subcommand is configured to accept a required file name option and an optional flag, which are bound to a struct named `SubcommandAOptions`. This struct holds the options' values, which are later used in the execution of the subcommand.

The file defines two main functions: [`setup_subcommand_a`](#setup_subcommand_a) and [`run_subcommand_a`](#run_subcommand_a). The [`setup_subcommand_a`](#setup_subcommand_a) function is responsible for creating the subcommand and binding its options to the `SubcommandAOptions` struct. It also sets a callback function that is executed when the subcommand is invoked. The [`run_subcommand_a`](#run_subcommand_a) function, which is called by the callback, performs the actual operations associated with the subcommand, such as printing the file name and checking if the optional flag is set. This separation of setup and execution logic enhances code clarity and maintainability. The file is intended to be part of a larger application, likely imported and used in conjunction with other components to build a comprehensive CLI tool.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `memory`


# Functions

---
### setup\_subcommand\_a<!-- {{#callable:setup_subcommand_a}} -->
The `setup_subcommand_a` function configures a subcommand for a CLI application, binding options to a shared options structure and setting a callback for execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `app`: A reference to a `CLI::App` object, which represents the command-line application to which the subcommand will be added.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a shared pointer `opt` to a `SubcommandAOptions` object to hold the options for the subcommand.
    - Add a subcommand named "subcommand_a" to the `app` with a description "performs subcommand a".
    - Add a required option `-f,--file` to the subcommand, binding it to `opt->file`.
    - Add a flag `--with-foo` to the subcommand, binding it to `opt->with_foo`.
    - Set a callback for the subcommand that calls [`run_subcommand_a`](#run_subcommand_a) with the options stored in `opt`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the `app` object by adding a subcommand with associated options and a callback.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`run_subcommand_a`](#run_subcommand_a)


---
### run\_subcommand\_a<!-- {{#callable:run_subcommand_a}} -->
The `run_subcommand_a` function executes actions based on the options provided for subcommand 'a', specifically printing messages related to a file and an optional flag.
- **Inputs**:
    - `opt`: A constant reference to a `SubcommandAOptions` struct containing options for the subcommand, including a file name and a boolean flag `with_foo`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Prints a message indicating the file being worked on using the `file` member of `opt`.
    - Checks if the `with_foo` flag in `opt` is true, and if so, prints an additional message indicating that 'foo' is being used.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs messages to the standard output.
