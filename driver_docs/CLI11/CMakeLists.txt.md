The `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `CLI11` codebase configures the build system for the CLI11 project, a header-only command line parser library, including options for building tests, examples, documentation, and handling installation and packaging.

# Purpose
The provided file is a CMake configuration file, which is used to manage the build process of a C++ project, specifically for the CLI11 library. This file defines the minimum required version of CMake, sets up project metadata, and configures various build options and dependencies. It includes options for building documentation, tests, and examples, and handles conditional configurations based on the environment, such as whether Doxygen is available for documentation generation. The file also manages installation paths and packaging details, ensuring that the library can be correctly built, tested, and packaged across different systems. This CMake file is crucial for automating the build process, ensuring consistency, and simplifying the integration of the CLI11 library into other projects.
# Content Summary
This CMake configuration file is designed for the CLI11 project, a header-only library for command-line parsing. The file specifies a minimum required CMake version between 3.10 and 3.31 and includes various configurations and options to facilitate building, testing, and installing the library.

Key technical details include:

1. **Version Management**: The file extracts the version number from the `CLI/Version.hpp` header file using a regular expression and sets it as the project version.

2. **Project Setup**: The project is defined with the name `CLI11`, and it is specified to use C++ as the programming language. The CMake module path is extended to include the project's `cmake` directory.

3. **Conditional Features**: The configuration includes conditional logic to handle different build scenarios. For instance, it checks for the presence of Doxygen to enable or disable documentation building. It also includes options for building tests, examples, and documentation based on the project's status as the main project and the availability of certain directories.

4. **Compiler and Build Options**: Several options are provided to customize the build process, such as `CLI11_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` to treat warnings as errors, `CLI11_SINGLE_FILE` to generate a single header file, and `CLI11_PRECOMPILED` to create a precompiled static library. There are also options to force the use of `libc++` with Clang on Linux and to enable CUDA tests.

5. **Installation and Packaging**: The file includes logic for installing the library and generating CMake package configuration files. It uses CPack to define packaging settings, including vendor information, contact details, and package versioning. The file also specifies files and directories to ignore during the packaging process.

6. **Source and Header Files**: The configuration lists the header files and implementation headers required for the library, organizing them into logical groups. It also includes subdirectories for fuzzing, source code, single-include files, tests, examples, and documentation.

7. **Build System Integration**: The file ensures compatibility with IDEs by enabling target grouping into folders and sets default C++ standards and extensions if not already defined.

Overall, this CMake configuration file provides a comprehensive setup for building, testing, and packaging the CLI11 library, with flexibility for different development environments and build configurations.
