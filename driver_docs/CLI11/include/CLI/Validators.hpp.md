The `Validators.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive set of classes and functions for validating and transforming command-line input, including checks for file existence, IP address validation, and unit conversion, among others.

# Purpose
This C++ header file is part of the CLI11 library, which is designed to facilitate command-line interface (CLI) parsing. The file primarily defines a set of classes and functions related to input validation, which are essential for ensuring that command-line arguments meet specific criteria before being processed by an application. The core component of this file is the [`Validator`](#validatorvalidator) class, which provides a flexible mechanism for defining custom validation logic. This class allows users to specify validation functions, descriptions, and other properties to tailor the validation process to their needs. Additionally, the file includes several pre-defined validators, such as `ExistingFileValidator`, `ExistingDirectoryValidator`, `IPV4Validator`, and [`Range`](#rangerange), which check for common conditions like file existence, directory existence, valid IP addresses, and numerical ranges.

The file also introduces more specialized validators like [`Transformer`](#transformertransformer) and [`CheckedTransformer`](#checkedtransformercheckedtransformer), which not only validate input but also transform it into a desired format. These components are crucial for applications that require input normalization or conversion. The file includes utility functions and classes within the `detail` namespace, which support the main validation logic by providing helper functions for tasks like type conversion, string manipulation, and set operations. Overall, this header file is a comprehensive collection of validation tools that can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of command-line applications by ensuring that inputs are correctly formatted and meet specified criteria.

### generate\_set<!-- {{#callable:detail::generate_set}} -->
The `generate_set` function creates a string representation of a set-like container, formatting its elements as a comma-separated list enclosed in curly braces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `set`: A set-like container of elements, which can be dereferenced to access its elements.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by determining the element type of the input set using `detail::element_type` and `detail::pair_adaptor` to handle potential pair elements.
    - It initializes a string `out` with an opening curly brace '{'.
    - The function appends to `out` a joined string of the set's elements, using `detail::join` to concatenate them with a comma separator, and `detail::pair_adaptor::first` to extract the first element of each pair if applicable.
    - Finally, it appends a closing curly brace '}' to `out` and returns the resulting string.
- **Output**: A string representing the set, formatted as a comma-separated list of its elements enclosed in curly braces.


---
### generate\_map<!-- {{#callable:detail::generate_map}} -->
The `generate_map` function creates a string representation of a map, optionally including only the keys.
- **Inputs**:
    - `map`: A map-like container of key-value pairs to be converted into a string representation.
    - `key_only`: A boolean flag indicating whether to include only keys (true) or both keys and values (false) in the output string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by defining the types for elements and iteration based on the input map's type.
    - It initializes a string `out` with an opening curly brace '{'.
    - The function uses `detail::join` to iterate over the map, converting each key-value pair to a string using a lambda function.
    - The lambda function checks the `key_only` flag to determine whether to append only the key or both key and value to the result string.
    - The result of the `join` operation is appended to `out`.
    - A closing curly brace '}' is added to `out`.
    - The function returns the constructed string `out`.
- **Output**: A string representing the map, formatted as '{key1->value1,key2->value2,...}' or '{key1,key2,...}' if `key_only` is true.


---
### search<!-- {{#callable:detail::search}} -->
The [`search`](#detailsearch) function attempts to find a value in a set, optionally applying a filter function to transform elements during the search.
- **Inputs**:
    - `set`: A collection of elements to search through, which can be any type that supports iteration.
    - `val`: The value to search for within the set.
    - `filter_function`: A function that transforms elements of the set during the search; it is optional and can be null.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first attempts a fast search using an overloaded [`search`](#detailsearch) function that does not apply the filter function.
    - If the fast search is successful or if the filter function is null, the result of the fast search is returned.
    - If the fast search fails and a filter function is provided, a linear search is performed over the set.
    - During the linear search, each element is transformed using the filter function before being compared to the search value.
    - The function returns a pair indicating whether the value was found and an iterator to the found element or the end of the set.
- **Output**: A `std::pair` where the first element is a boolean indicating if the value was found, and the second element is an iterator to the found element or the end of the set.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`detail::search`](#detailsearch)


---
### overflowCheck<!-- {{#callable:detail::overflowCheck}} -->
The `overflowCheck` function checks if multiplying two unsigned integers would result in an overflow.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The first unsigned integer to be multiplied.
    - `b`: The second unsigned integer to be multiplied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `std::enable_if` to ensure it only operates on unsigned types.
    - It calculates the maximum value of the type `T` using `std::numeric_limits<T>::max()`.
    - It checks if the maximum value divided by `a` is less than `b`, which would indicate an overflow if `a` and `b` were multiplied.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether multiplying `a` and `b` would cause an overflow (true if overflow would occur, false otherwise).


---
### checked\_multiply<!-- {{#callable:detail::checked_multiply}} -->
The `checked_multiply` function multiplies two floating-point numbers and checks for overflow, updating the first argument with the result if no overflow occurs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A reference to a floating-point number that will be multiplied by `b` and updated with the result if no overflow occurs.
    - `b`: A floating-point number that will be multiplied with `a`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the product of `a` and `b` and store it in `c`.
    - Check if `c` is infinite while both `a` and `b` are not infinite.
    - If the above condition is true, return `false` indicating overflow.
    - Otherwise, update `a` with the value of `c` and return `true`.
- **Output**: Returns `true` if the multiplication does not result in an overflow (infinity), otherwise returns `false`.


---
### ignore\_case<!-- {{#callable:ignore_case}} -->
The `ignore_case` function converts a given string to lowercase using a helper function from the `detail` namespace.
- **Inputs**:
    - `item`: A string that needs to be converted to lowercase.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single string argument named `item`.
    - It calls the `detail::to_lower` function with `item` as the argument.
    - The result of `detail::to_lower(item)` is returned.
- **Output**: A new string that is the lowercase version of the input string.


---
### ignore\_underscore<!-- {{#callable:ignore_underscore}} -->
The `ignore_underscore` function removes underscores from a given string by calling the `remove_underscore` function from the `detail` namespace.
- **Inputs**:
    - `item`: A string from which underscores need to be removed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is a single-line inline function that directly returns the result of calling `detail::remove_underscore` with the input string `item`.
- **Output**: A string with all underscores removed from the input string.


---
### ignore\_space<!-- {{#callable:ignore_space}} -->
The `ignore_space` function removes all spaces and tab characters from a given string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `item`: A string from which spaces and tab characters are to be removed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `std::remove` to remove all space characters (' ') from the string.
    - It then uses `std::remove` again to remove all tab characters ('\t') from the string.
    - The `erase` method is used to actually remove the characters from the string after `std::remove` shifts them to the end.
    - The modified string is returned.
- **Output**: A string with all spaces and tab characters removed.


---
### operator|<!-- {{#callable:operator|}} -->
The `operator|` function performs a bitwise OR operation on two `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` objects and returns the result as a new `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The first `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object to be used in the bitwise OR operation.
    - `b`: The second `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object to be used in the bitwise OR operation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` objects as input parameters.
    - It casts each `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object to an integer.
    - It performs a bitwise OR operation on the two integers.
    - The result of the bitwise OR operation is cast back to an `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object.
    - The function returns the resulting `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object.
- **Output**: A new `AsNumberWithUnit::Options` object that is the result of the bitwise OR operation on the input options.


---
### Validator<!-- {{#callable:CLI::Validator::Validator}} -->
The `Validator` constructor initializes a `Validator` object with a description and a validation function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `validator_desc`: A string representing the description of the validator.
    - `func`: A function that takes a reference to a string and returns a string, used for validation logic.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The constructor initializes the `desc_function_` member with a lambda that returns the `validator_desc` string.
    - The `func_` member is initialized with the provided `func` after moving it to ensure efficient resource management.
- **Output**: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes a `Validator` object.


---
### AsNumberWithUnit<!-- {{#callable:AsNumberWithUnit::AsNumberWithUnit}} -->
The `AsNumberWithUnit` function template constructs a validator that converts a string with a numeric value and an optional unit into a numeric value by applying a unit conversion factor from a provided mapping.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mapping`: A `std::map` where keys are unit strings and values are conversion factors of type `Number`.
    - `opts`: An `Options` enum value that specifies behavior such as case sensitivity and whether a unit is required; defaults to `DEFAULT`.
    - `unit_name`: A `std::string` representing the name of the unit, defaulting to "UNIT".
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by generating a description using `generate_description` and validates the mapping with `validate_mapping`.
    - A lambda function `func_` is defined to process the input string, trimming whitespace and checking for an empty input, which throws a `ValidationError` if true.
    - The function identifies the position where the unit begins in the input string by iterating backward from the end until a non-alphabetic character is found.
    - The unit is extracted from the input, and the input is resized to exclude the unit part, followed by trimming.
    - If the `UNIT_REQUIRED` option is set and no unit is found, a `ValidationError` is thrown.
    - If `CASE_INSENSITIVE` is set, the unit string is converted to lowercase.
    - If no unit is present, the input is converted to a number using `lexical_cast`, and a `ValidationError` is thrown if conversion fails.
    - If a unit is present, the function looks up the unit in the mapping; if not found, a `ValidationError` is thrown with allowed values.
    - If the input is not empty, it is converted to a number and multiplied by the unit's conversion factor using `checked_multiply`, throwing a `ValidationError` on failure.
    - If the input is empty, the number is set to the conversion factor of the unit.
    - The input string is updated with the converted numeric value.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value directly; it modifies the input string to contain the converted numeric value or throws a `ValidationError` if validation fails.
