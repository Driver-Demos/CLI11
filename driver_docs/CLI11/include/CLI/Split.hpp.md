The `Split.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides utility functions for parsing and splitting command-line option strings into short, long, and Windows-style options, as well as extracting default flag values.

# Purpose
This C++ header file is part of the CLI11 library, which is designed to facilitate command-line interface (CLI) parsing. The file primarily focuses on the internal implementation details related to parsing and handling command-line options. It defines several inline functions within the `CLI::detail` namespace, which are used to split and interpret different styles of command-line options, such as short options, long options, and Windows-style options. These functions are crucial for breaking down command-line arguments into their constituent parts, such as option names and values, which can then be processed by the CLI11 library to configure and execute command-line applications.

The file includes necessary standard library headers and a custom "Macros.hpp" header, indicating that it relies on both standard and custom utilities. The use of inline functions suggests a focus on performance, as these functions are likely to be called frequently during command-line parsing. The file also includes a conditional inclusion of an implementation file, "impl/Split_inl.hpp," which suggests that additional implementation details are separated to maintain a clean interface. This header file does not define public APIs directly but provides essential internal functionality that supports the broader CLI11 library's public interface.
