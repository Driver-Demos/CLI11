The `Version.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the version information for the library, specifying it as version 2.5.0.

# Purpose
This C header file is a versioning configuration file for the CLI11 library, a command-line interface library. It defines preprocessor macros that specify the major, minor, and patch version numbers of the library, as well as a string representation of the complete version ("2.5.0"). The use of `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once per compilation, preventing duplicate definitions. The file also includes a directive for the "Include What You Use" (IWYU) tool, indicating that it should be included via "CLI/CLI.hpp" to maintain proper dependency management. This file is essential for maintaining version consistency and compatibility checks within projects using the CLI11 library.
