The `Formatter.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase is a header file that includes necessary libraries and headers for formatting functionality within the CLI11 library.

# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file, as indicated by the `#pragma once` directive, which is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file. It is part of a library, likely named CLI11, intended to be imported and used elsewhere, as suggested by the inclusion of other headers like "App.hpp" and "FormatterFwd.hpp". The code provides narrow functionality, focusing on the inclusion and organization of components related to command-line interface (CLI) formatting, as indicated by the namespace `CLI` and the inclusion of "Formatter_inl.hpp" when `CLI11_COMPILE` is not defined. The use of `#include` directives for standard libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` suggests that the library may perform operations involving string manipulation and data storage, typical in CLI applications. The presence of comments and structured include guards indicates a well-documented and organized codebase, likely part of a larger project developed under the auspices of the University of Cincinnati.
