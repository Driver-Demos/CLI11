The `Timer.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a simple timer class with customizable pretty printing and an `AutoTimer` class that prints the elapsed time upon destruction.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file defines a utility for timing operations, encapsulated within the `CLI` namespace. The primary class, [`Timer`](#timertimer), provides functionality to measure elapsed time and format it into a human-readable string. It uses the `std::chrono` library to track time intervals and offers customizable output through user-defined formatting functions. The [`Timer`](#timertimer) class includes methods to start timing upon instantiation, measure the duration of a function execution, and format the elapsed time in various units (nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds) based on the duration. Additionally, the file defines an [`AutoTimer`](#autotimerautotimer) class, which inherits from [`Timer`](#timertimer) and automatically prints the elapsed time upon destruction, making it useful for scope-based timing.

The file is structured as a C++ header file, intended to be included in other projects that require timing functionality. It provides a public API through the [`Timer`](#timertimer) and [`AutoTimer`](#autotimerautotimer) classes, allowing users to instantiate timers, measure execution times, and output formatted timing results. The file also includes a custom stream insertion operator for the [`Timer`](#timertimer) class, enabling easy integration with standard output streams like `std::cout`. The code is designed to be portable and compatible with older versions of GCC by conditionally defining missing macros, ensuring broader usability across different compiler environments.

### Timer<!-- {{#data_structure:CLI::Timer}} -->
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `title_`: This is the title of the timer.
    - `time_print_`: This is the function that is used to format most of the timing message.
    - `start_`: This is the starting point (when the timer was created).
    - `cycles`: This is the number of times cycles (print divides by this number).
- **Description**: The `Timer` class is a utility for measuring and formatting time intervals in a program. It uses the `std::chrono::steady_clock` to track time and provides customizable output formatting through a function pointer `time_print_t`. The class includes a default constructor that initializes the timer with a title and a print function, and it offers methods to time a function execution, format the elapsed time into a string, and output the timing information. The class also supports division of the timing result by a specified number of cycles, allowing for averaged timing results.
