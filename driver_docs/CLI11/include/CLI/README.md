The `CLI` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains a comprehensive set of header files and an `impl` folder, providing functionalities for creating and managing command-line applications, including argument parsing, configuration handling, error management, and input validation.

## Folders
- **[impl](impl/README.md)**: The `impl` folder in the `CLI11` codebase contains a collection of inline implementation files that provide detailed functionalities for parsing command-line arguments, managing configurations, formatting help text, handling string manipulations, and validating inputs.

## Files
- **[App.hpp](App.hpp.md)**: The `App.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the `App` class, which is used to create and manage command-line applications, including options, flags, subcommands, and various configurations for parsing and handling command-line arguments.
- **[Argv.hpp](Argv.hpp.md)**: The `Argv.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides functionality for handling command-line arguments, including a method to decode UTF-8 arguments on Windows systems.
- **[CLI.hpp](CLI.hpp.md)**: The `CLI.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase serves as a central include header that aggregates various components of the CLI library, such as versioning, macros, encoding, argument handling, string tools, error management, type tools, configuration, validators, options, and application setup.
- **[Config.hpp](Config.hpp.md)**: The `Config.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides utility functions for handling configuration-related tasks, such as converting arguments for INI files, joining strings with quotes, and managing parent segments in configuration items.
- **[ConfigFwd.hpp](ConfigFwd.hpp.md)**: The `ConfigFwd.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines classes and structures for handling configuration files, including support for INI and TOML formats, with functionality to convert between application configurations and file representations.
- **[Encoding.hpp](Encoding.hpp.md)**: The `Encoding.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides functions for converting between wide and narrow strings, and includes additional functionality for handling filesystem paths when supported.
- **[Error.hpp](Error.hpp.md)**: The `Error.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines a hierarchy of error classes for handling various error conditions related to command-line interface parsing and construction, including specific errors like `ConstructionError`, `ParseError`, and `OptionNotFound`.
- **[Formatter.hpp](Formatter.hpp.md)**: The `Formatter.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase is a header file that includes necessary libraries and headers for formatting functionality within the CLI11 library.
- **[FormatterFwd.hpp](FormatterFwd.hpp.md)**: The `FormatterFwd.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the base and specialized classes for formatting help output in command-line applications, including customizable options for column widths and formatting styles.
- **[Macros.hpp](Macros.hpp.md)**: The `Macros.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines a series of preprocessor macros for handling C++ version detection, deprecation attributes, RTTI usage, and feature availability such as `<filesystem>` and `<codecvt>`.
- **[Option.hpp](Option.hpp.md)**: The `Option.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines classes and functionalities for handling command-line options, including setting and retrieving option properties, managing multi-option policies, and validating input.
- **[Split.hpp](Split.hpp.md)**: The `Split.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides utility functions for parsing and splitting command-line option strings into short, long, and Windows-style options, as well as extracting default flag values.
- **[StringTools.hpp](StringTools.hpp.md)**: The `StringTools.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a collection of utility functions for string manipulation, including trimming, joining, splitting, and handling of quoted and escaped strings, as well as support for enum streaming.
- **[Timer.hpp](Timer.hpp.md)**: The `Timer.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a simple timer class with customizable pretty printing and an `AutoTimer` class that prints the elapsed time upon destruction.
- **[TypeTools.hpp](TypeTools.hpp.md)**: The `TypeTools.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive set of utilities and type traits for type enabling, type classification, and lexical casting, supporting various operations such as type conversion, string conversion, and type categorization.
- **[Validators.hpp](Validators.hpp.md)**: The `Validators.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive set of classes and functions for validating and transforming command-line input, including checks for file existence, IP address validation, and unit conversion, among others.
- **[Version.hpp](Version.hpp.md)**: The `Version.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the version information for the library, specifying it as version 2.5.0.
