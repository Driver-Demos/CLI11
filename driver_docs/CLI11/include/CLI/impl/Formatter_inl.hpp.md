The `Formatter_inl.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides inline implementations for formatting command-line interface help text, including options, groups, subcommands, and usage descriptions.

# Purpose
This C++ source code file is part of a library designed to facilitate command-line interface (CLI) creation and management, specifically focusing on formatting help and usage messages for CLI applications. The file defines a series of inline functions within the `CLI` namespace, which are part of a `Formatter` class. These functions are responsible for generating formatted strings that describe the application's options, groups, subcommands, and overall usage. The code includes methods like [`make_group`](#stringmake_group), [`make_positionals`](#stringmake_positionals), [`make_groups`](#stringmake_groups), [`make_description`](#stringmake_description), [`make_usage`](#stringmake_usage), [`make_footer`](#stringmake_footer), and [`make_help`](#stringmake_help), each of which constructs a specific part of the help message by iterating over the application's options and subcommands, and formatting them according to the specified rules.

The file is structured to be included in other parts of the CLI library, as indicated by the use of `#pragma once` and the inclusion of necessary headers. It provides a narrow but essential functionality within the broader context of the CLI library, focusing on the presentation layer of command-line applications. The code does not define a public API directly but rather implements internal methods that are likely used by other components of the library to generate user-facing help documentation. The use of inline functions suggests an emphasis on performance, as these functions are intended to be expanded at compile time, reducing the overhead of function calls.
