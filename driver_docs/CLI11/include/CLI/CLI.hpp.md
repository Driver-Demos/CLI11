The `CLI.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase serves as a central include header that aggregates various components of the CLI library, such as versioning, macros, encoding, argument handling, string tools, error management, type tools, configuration, validators, options, and application setup.

# Purpose
This code is a C++ header file that serves as an inclusion point for a collection of other header files, likely part of a library related to command-line interface (CLI) functionality. The use of `#pragma once` indicates that this file is intended to prevent multiple inclusions, which is a common practice in header files to avoid redefinition errors. The file includes a series of headers such as "Version.hpp", "Argv.hpp", and "App.hpp", suggesting that it provides a broad range of functionalities related to versioning, argument handling, and application configuration. The presence of comments about the order of includes and the use of "IWYU pragma" (Include What You Use) suggests that this file is carefully structured to optimize dependency management and compilation efficiency. Overall, this header file is designed to be imported elsewhere, serving as a central point to include various components of a CLI library.
