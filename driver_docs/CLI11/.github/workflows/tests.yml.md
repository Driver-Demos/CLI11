The `tests.yml` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines a GitHub Actions workflow for running various tests and builds, including coverage, Catch2, Clang-Tidy, CUDA, Boost, Meson, Bazel, and CMake configuration checks across different environments and configurations.

# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file, written in YAML, which automates various tasks related to building, testing, and validating a software project. This file is designed to trigger on specific events such as pushes to the main branch or pull requests, and it defines multiple jobs that run on different environments and configurations. Each job is responsible for a specific task, such as code coverage analysis, building with different compilers and configurations, running tests, and checking compatibility with various CMake versions. The file's content is crucial for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes, ensuring that the codebase is consistently tested and validated across different platforms and configurations, thereby maintaining code quality and reliability.
# Content Summary
This file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration, designed to automate various testing and build processes for a software project. The workflow is triggered by pushes to the `main` branch or any branch matching the pattern `v*`, as well as by pull requests. It employs concurrency control to ensure that only one instance of a workflow group runs at a time, canceling any in-progress runs if a new one is triggered.

The workflow defines multiple jobs, each targeting different aspects of the software's build and test processes:

1. **Coverage**: This job runs on `ubuntu-latest` and uses a matrix strategy to test different C++ standards (11, 14, 17, 20) and precompile settings (ON, OFF). It installs `lcov` for coverage analysis, configures the build with CMake, compiles the code, runs tests, and prepares coverage reports, which are then uploaded using the Codecov action.

2. **Catch2-3**: This job runs on `macos-latest` and installs Catch2 via Homebrew. It configures, builds, and tests the project using CMake with C++14 and precompiled headers enabled.

3. **Clang-Tidy**: Running on `ubuntu-latest` within a Clang 20 container, this job configures the project with CMake to use Clang-Tidy for static analysis, treating all warnings as errors.

4. **CUDA Builds**: There are two separate jobs for building with CUDA 11 and CUDA 12, each using a specific NVIDIA CUDA container. These jobs install necessary tools, configure the project for CUDA tests, and build the project.

5. **Boost Build**: This job runs on `ubuntu-24.04`, installs Boost, and builds the project with Boost support enabled. It also runs tests using CTest.

6. **Meson Build**: This job uses Meson and Ninja to configure, build, and test the project on `ubuntu-latest`.

7. **Bazel Build**: This job builds and tests the project using Bazel on `ubuntu-latest`.

8. **Install Tests**: There are three jobs for testing installation processes: standard, precompiled, and single-file. Each job configures, builds, installs, and tests the project using CMake and CTest.

9. **CMake Config Checks**: Two jobs check compatibility with various CMake versions on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04. They use a custom action to verify the project configuration with different CMake versions, ensuring compatibility and enabling specific features like sanitizers and JSON example builds.

Overall, this workflow ensures comprehensive testing across different environments, configurations, and build systems, enhancing the reliability and portability of the software project.
