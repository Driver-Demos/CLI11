The `labeler_merged.yml` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines GitHub labeler rules to identify pull requests that do not modify the `CHANGELOG.md` or `README.md` files.

# Purpose
The file specifies conditions for checking the presence of essential documentation files in a codebase. It defines two requirements: a changelog and a README, each with a rule that excludes the respective file ("!CHANGELOG.md" and "!README.md") from being considered missing. This configuration is likely used in a validation or linting process to ensure these files are present.
