The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the `CLI11` codebase configures pre-commit hooks for code formatting, linting, and style checks using various tools like Black, Clang-Format, Prettier, and Codespell, while excluding certain directories and specifying commit messages for CI updates and fixes.

# Purpose
This file is a configuration file for the pre-commit framework, which is used to manage and run pre-commit hooks in a codebase. The file specifies a series of repositories and their respective hooks that are executed to enforce code quality and style standards before changes are committed. The configuration includes hooks for code formatting, syntax checking, and style enforcement across various programming languages and file types, such as Python, C++, YAML, Markdown, and more. The file also includes specific commit message templates for automated updates and fixes, as well as exclusions for certain directories and files from the pre-commit checks. This configuration is crucial for maintaining code consistency and preventing common errors, thereby enhancing the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
# Content Summary
This configuration file is a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file used to set up pre-commit hooks for a software project. Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before a commit is made, ensuring code quality and consistency by enforcing certain checks and formatting rules.

Key components of the file include:

1. **Exclusion Patterns**: The `exclude` field specifies directories and files that should be ignored by the pre-commit hooks. In this configuration, files within `.github/workflows/`, `docs/img/`, and `tests/fuzzFail` are excluded.

2. **CI Commit Messages**: The `ci` section defines custom commit messages for automatic updates and fixes performed by `pre-commit.ci`. The `autoupdate_commit_msg` is set to "chore(deps): pre-commit.ci autoupdate", and the `autofix_commit_msg` is "style: pre-commit.ci fixes".

3. **Repositories and Hooks**: The `repos` section lists various repositories and their respective hooks that are used to enforce code standards:
   - **Black**: A Python code formatter from the `psf/black` repository, version 25.1.0.
   - **Pre-commit Hooks**: A collection of general-purpose hooks from `pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks`, version v5.0.0, including checks for large files, case conflicts, merge conflicts, YAML and TOML syntax, and more.
   - **Clang-Format**: A code formatter for C++, C, and CUDA from `pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format`, version v20.1.5.
   - **CMake-Format**: A formatter for CMake files from `cheshirekow/cmake-format-precommit`, version v0.6.13, with an additional dependency on `pyyaml`.
   - **Prettier**: A code formatter for various file types from `pre-commit/mirrors-prettier`, version "v4.0.0-alpha.8", with specific arguments for prose wrapping.
   - **Markdownlint**: A linter for Markdown files from `markdownlint/markdownlint`, version v0.12.0, with a custom style file.
   - **Codespell**: A spell checker from `codespell-project/codespell`, version v2.4.1, with specific words excluded from checks.

4. **Local Hooks**: Custom hooks defined locally within the project:
   - **Disallow Caps**: A hook to disallow improper capitalization of certain terms using `pygrep`.
   - **Avoid MSVC Macro**: A hook to avoid using certain macros in MSVC 2017 or earlier, also using `pygrep`.

This configuration ensures that code adheres to specified formatting and style guidelines, reducing errors and maintaining consistency across the codebase.
