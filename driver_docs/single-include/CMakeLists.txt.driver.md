# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script designed to handle the generation and management of a single-header version of the CLI11 library. This script checks if the `CLI11_SINGLE_FILE` option is enabled, and if so, it sets up the necessary environment to create a single-header file using a Python script (`MakeSingleHeader.py`). It ensures compatibility with different CMake versions by conditionally finding the Python interpreter. The script creates a custom command to generate the `CLI11.hpp` file, which consolidates multiple header files into one, and sets up a custom target to manage this process. Additionally, it configures the installation of the generated header file and defines an interface library `CLI11_SINGLE` that links to the main CLI11 library, ensuring that the single-header version is properly integrated into the build system.
