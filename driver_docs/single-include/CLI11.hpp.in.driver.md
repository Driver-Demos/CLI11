# Purpose
This file is a standalone header file for the CLI11 library, which is designed to facilitate the creation of command-line interfaces in C++ applications. The file is generated by a script and consolidates various components of the library into a single header, making it easy to include and use in other projects. It provides broad functionality by incorporating multiple modules such as encoding, argument parsing, string manipulation, error handling, and configuration management, all of which are essential for building robust CLI applications. The file is intended to be imported into other C++ projects, allowing developers to leverage the comprehensive features of CLI11 without needing to manage multiple separate files. The inclusion of various headers and inline implementations within a single namespace indicates a well-organized structure aimed at simplifying the integration process for developers.
