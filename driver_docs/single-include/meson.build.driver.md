# Purpose
The provided content is from a `meson.build` file, which is used in the Meson build system to define build instructions for a software project. This particular script is responsible for generating a single header file, `CLI11.hpp`, from multiple input files using a Python script, `MakeSingleHeader.py`. The script checks if the `use_single_header` option is enabled, and if so, it creates a custom target that specifies the input files, output file, and the command to execute the Python script. The `custom_target` ensures that the header file is generated before it is included in the build process. If `use_single_header` is not enabled, it initializes `single_header` as an empty list to maintain consistency in the build configuration.
