# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML. This file automates the build and release process for a software project whenever there is a push to the main branch, any branch starting with "v", or any tag, as well as on pull requests. The workflow defines a job named "single-header" that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. It includes steps to check out the repository, set up a Python environment, prepare a CMake configuration, build source packages, and generate a single header file. The workflow also uploads the generated artifacts, such as the single header file and source packages, and creates a GitHub release if the workflow is triggered by a tag. This automation ensures consistent and efficient handling of build and release tasks.
