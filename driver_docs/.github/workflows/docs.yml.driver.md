# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration written in YAML, designed to automate the generation and deployment of documentation for a software project. The workflow is triggered by events such as manual dispatch, pull requests, and pushes to the main branch. It defines three jobs: `apidocs`, `gitbook`, and `pages`. The `apidocs` job uses Doxygen to generate API documentation, while the `gitbook` job builds a GitBook from source files, converting it into both HTML and PDF formats. The `pages` job, which depends on the successful completion of the previous two jobs, configures and deploys the generated documentation to GitHub Pages, ensuring that the latest documentation is available online for the repository `CLIUtils/CLI11`. The workflow also manages permissions and concurrency to ensure efficient and secure execution.
