# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for a GitHub Action workflow, designed to automate the setup and execution of CMake, a cross-platform build system. The file specifies a composite action that requires a specific version of CMake, which is defined by the `cmake-version` input, and optionally accepts additional arguments through the `args` input. The workflow consists of two main steps: first, it uses the `jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake@v2.0.2` action to ensure the specified CMake version is available; second, it creates a temporary build directory, runs CMake with the provided arguments, and then cleans up the temporary files. This setup facilitates the integration of CMake into continuous integration pipelines, ensuring consistent build environments across different runs.
