# Purpose
The provided content is from a "Contributing" guide, typically found in open-source software repositories. This file is designed to guide contributors on how to effectively contribute to the CLI11 project, ensuring that contributions align with the project's standards and practices. It provides specific instructions on adding new functionality, maintaining code quality, and adhering to style guidelines, such as using Doxygen for documentation and ensuring 100% test coverage. The document also outlines the use of tools like pre-commit for code formatting and clang-tidy for code analysis, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistency and quality across the codebase. Additionally, it includes sections for maintainers on how to manage contributions and release new versions, ensuring that the project remains organized and up-to-date. This file is crucial for maintaining the integrity and quality of the codebase while fostering a collaborative and efficient development environment.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a contribution guide for the CLI11 project, detailing the procedures and standards for submitting a Pull Request (PR). It outlines several key areas that contributors should be aware of to ensure their contributions align with the project's requirements.

Firstly, contributors are reminded to be comfortable with the project's licensing terms, as all contributions will be licensed under the original license. When adding new functionality, contributors must ensure that new functions are documented using Doxygen-style comments (`///`), mentioned in the README, explained in the PR or an associated issue, and fully covered by tests. The guide emphasizes the importance of thoughtful additions that do not unnecessarily increase the complexity of CLI11.

The document also highlights the importance of maintaining high code quality and consistency. It specifies that all code must pass automated tests across supported platforms, maintain 100% test coverage, and adhere to formatting standards enforced by pre-commit hooks. Contributors are encouraged to use `clang-tidy` for static code analysis and ensure compliance with the Google C++ Style Guide, as checked by `cpplint`.

For formatting, the guide instructs contributors to use `pre-commit`, a tool that can be installed via pip, to automatically format code before committing. It provides commands for running pre-commit checks on staged files or all files and suggests installing it as a git hook for continuous use.

For maintainers, the guide includes instructions on acknowledging contributions using the all-contributors CLI, which involves adding contributors' usernames and specifying their type of contribution. It also provides a checklist for making a release, which includes updating the changelog, version numbers, and specific emoji replacements in the README to reflect new releases.

Overall, this document serves as a comprehensive guide for both contributors and maintainers, ensuring that contributions are well-documented, tested, and adhere to the project's coding standards.
