# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script used to define build instructions for a software project, specifically related to fuzz testing components of the CLI11 library. The script checks if the C++ standard version is greater than 16 and whether the `CLI11_FUZZ_TARGET` option is enabled. If so, it sets up two fuzz testing executables, `cli11_app_fuzzer` and `cli11_file_fuzzer`, linking them with the CLI11 library and organizing them under a "Tests" folder. It also configures custom targets for quick fuzz testing, specifying directories, time limits, and dictionary files for the fuzzing process. If the `CLI11_FUZZ_TARGET` is not enabled but `CLI11_BUILD_EXAMPLES` is, it builds an example executable named `cli11Fuzz`, placing it in an "Examples" folder. This script is crucial for automating the build and testing process, ensuring that the software is robust against unexpected inputs.
