# Purpose
This file is an EditorConfig configuration file that enforces consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs. It specifies settings such as using spaces for indentation, ensuring a newline at the end of files, using LF for line endings, and trimming trailing whitespace. It also defines specific indentation sizes for files with extensions `.cpp`, `.hpp`, and `.py` as 4 spaces, and `.yml` files as 2 spaces.
