# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt explaining how to integrate and customize the CLI11 library within a software toolkit. CLI11 is a command-line interface library designed to offer a seamless user experience, as exemplified by its integration into GooFit, where it enhances the user interface for ROOT users. The document outlines how to incorporate CLI11 into a custom namespace, suggesting the use of `using CLI::App` to simplify access to its components, and provides guidance on creating a custom parsing macro for error handling. Additionally, it describes subclassing the `App` class to customize application behavior, including setting default options and adding flags. The document also highlights the availability of virtual functions, such as `pre_callback`, which can be overridden to execute custom actions before the main application callbacks.
