# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for the internal workings of the CLI11 library, which is a command-line interface parser for C++. The document outlines the library's design philosophy, particularly its use of lambda functions to bind command-line options to existing variables without necessitating typed classes or inheritance. It details the parsing process, which involves validating options, parsing command-line entries, and executing callbacks, ensuring that options and subcommands are handled consistently. The document also describes the error-handling mechanism, where the library throws C++ exceptions in response to issues like incorrect constructions or malformed command lines. This documentation is crucial for developers who need to understand the internal processes and error management of the CLI11 library to effectively integrate and utilize it in their applications.
