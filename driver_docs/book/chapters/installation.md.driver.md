# Purpose
The provided content is a comprehensive installation and configuration guide for integrating the CLI11 library into C++ projects. CLI11 is a command-line interface library that can be included in projects either as a single header file or as a full multi-file edition, offering additional utilities and features. The document details various methods for incorporating CLI11 into a project, including using CMake, Meson, vcpkg, and Conan, each providing different levels of integration and dependency management. It also covers specific instructions for different compilers and platforms, such as GCC, Clang, and WASI, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance. This guide is crucial for developers looking to leverage CLI11 in their applications, providing them with the necessary steps to configure and link the library effectively within their build systems.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive guide for integrating the CLI11 library into C++ projects. CLI11 is a command-line interface library that can be included in projects in two main forms: a single file edition and a full edition. The single file edition involves downloading `CLI11.hpp` and including it directly in the project, which is the simplest method. The full edition, on the other hand, offers additional utilities and can be integrated using CMake, Meson, or other package managers like Conan and vcpkg.

For projects using CMake, CLI11 can be added as a subdirectory or through `FetchContent`, allowing for easy integration and management of dependencies. The library can be linked using `target_link_libraries` with the `CLI11::CLI11` target. CMake also supports precompiled static libraries to improve compile times when CLI11 is used extensively across a project. Additionally, CLI11 supports Meson through pkg-config and subprojects, and it can be installed using vcpkg or Conan for dependency management.

The document also provides instructions for running tests on CLI11 using CMake, which includes over 200 tests to ensure compatibility and functionality. Special instructions are given for using CLI11 with GCC 8, certain versions of clang, and WASI, addressing specific linking requirements and compiler flags.

For developers who prefer using system packages, CLI11 can be installed via package managers on Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora. This method provides a stable version of the library, which can be easily integrated into CMake projects.

Overall, the document serves as a detailed installation and configuration guide for developers looking to incorporate CLI11 into their C++ projects, offering multiple methods and tools to suit different project needs and environments.
