# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt explaining the basic usage of the CLI11 library, which is a command-line interface (CLI) library for C++. It describes the simplest form of a CLI11 program, starting with the inclusion of the library and the creation of a `CLI::App` object, which serves as the foundation for interacting with the library. The document highlights the use of the `CLI11_PARSE` macro, which simplifies the parsing of command-line arguments and handles errors gracefully by throwing a `ParseError` that can be caught to manage application exit codes and messages. Additionally, it provides a brief guide on compiling and running a basic example on macOS or Linux, demonstrating how to generate and execute an output executable while displaying help options. This documentation is intended to help users quickly understand and implement a basic CLI application using the CLI11 library.
