# Purpose
This document is a markdown file that provides detailed instructions on customizing the help output of a command-line interface (CLI) application using the CLI11 library. It offers narrow functionality focused on configuring the appearance and behavior of help messages in CLI applications. The file is organized into several conceptual components, including customizing existing formatters, subclassing formatters, and understanding the anatomy of a help message. The content is relevant to a codebase as it guides developers on how to modify the default help output to better suit their application's needs, enhancing user experience by allowing for tailored help messages. The document includes examples of code snippets in C++ to demonstrate how to implement these customizations effectively.
# Content Summary
This document provides detailed instructions on customizing the help output formatting in the CLI11 library, a command-line interface library for C++. It introduces the concept of customizing the default formatter, which is designed to be flexible and modifiable. Developers can retrieve the current formatter using `app.get_formatter()` and apply custom settings that will be inherited by any subcommands created thereafter.

Key configuration options include setting the column width with `column_width(width)` and modifying labels with `label(key, value)`. For instance, developers can change the column width to 40 and alter the `REQUIRED` label to `(MUST HAVE)` using the provided methods.

The document also explains how to subclass the formatter to further customize the help output. By subclassing, developers can override virtual functions to modify specific parts of the formatting. An example is provided where a custom formatter class, `MyFormatter`, is created to remove information between the option name and description.

Additionally, the document outlines the structure of a help message, detailing the methods used to generate each part of the output. It describes the sequence of method calls such as `make_description`, `make_usage`, `make_positionals`, and others, which collectively build the help message. The anatomy of a typical option printout is also illustrated, showing how different methods contribute to the final output.

Overall, this document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to tailor the help output of their CLI applications using CLI11, providing both high-level customization options and low-level subclassing techniques.
