# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program that demonstrates the use of command-line flags using the CLI11 library. The primary purpose of this code is to provide a simple example of how to define and parse command-line flags in a C++ application. The code includes the CLI11 library, which is a powerful and flexible library for handling command-line arguments. The program defines three types of flags: a boolean flag (`--bool` or `-b`), an integer flag (`--int` or `-i`), and a plain flag (`--plain` or `-p`). These flags are added to the `CLI::App` object, which represents the command-line application.

The main technical components of this code include the setup of the `CLI::App` object, the addition of flags using the `add_flag` method, and the parsing of command-line arguments with `app.parse(argc, argv)`. The code also includes error handling for parsing errors using a try-catch block. After parsing, the program checks which flags were passed and outputs corresponding messages to the console. This file is a standalone executable and does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as its primary function is to illustrate the usage of command-line flags in a C++ application.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a command-line interface application to parse and handle boolean, integer, and plain flags, then outputs the results based on the flags provided.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the actual command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by setting up a CLI application using the `CLI::App` class with a description 'Flag example program'.
    - Three flags are defined: a boolean flag `--bool` or `-b`, an integer flag `-i` or `--int`, and a plain flag `--plain` or `-p`.
    - The function attempts to parse the command-line arguments using `app.parse(argc, argv)`.
    - If a `CLI::ParseError` is caught during parsing, the function returns an error code using `app.exit(e)`.
    - After successful parsing, the function outputs 'The flags program'.
    - It checks if the boolean flag is set and outputs 'Bool flag passed' if true.
    - It checks if the integer flag is greater than 0 and outputs 'Flag int: ' followed by the integer value if true.
    - It checks if the plain flag is set and outputs 'Flag plain: ' followed by the count of how many times the flag was set.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is 0 on successful execution or an error code if a parsing error occurs.
