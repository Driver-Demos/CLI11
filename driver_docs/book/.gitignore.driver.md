# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify intentionally untracked files to ignore. It lists directories and file patterns related to build outputs, dependencies, and intermediate storage, such as `.grunt`, `node_modules`, `_book`, and various eBook formats, ensuring they are not included in version control.
