# Purpose
This file is a pkg-config metadata file used to provide the necessary compiler and linker flags for the CLI11 library, a C++ command line parser. It defines variables for installation paths such as `prefix`, `exec_prefix`, and `includedir`, and specifies the library's name, description, and version. The `Cflags` line provides the compiler flag to include the library's header files.
