# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script that defines a special target named `CLI11_warnings` for managing compiler warnings in a C++ project. This target is not exported, meaning it is used internally within the build system to enforce specific warning flags during compilation. The script sets up a list of warning flags, `unix-warnings`, which includes common warnings like `-Wall` and `-Wextra`, and conditionally appends additional warnings based on the compiler being used, such as Clang or GCC. For Clang, specific warnings are added unless the version is 3.4, where certain flags are known to be problematic. Similarly, for GCC versions 4.9 and above, the `-Weffc++` flag is included. The script also configures the `CLI11_warnings` target to treat warnings as errors if the `CLI11_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` flag is set, ensuring stricter code quality checks during the build process.
