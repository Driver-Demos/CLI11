# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration snippet for a build pipeline, likely used in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environment. It outlines a series of steps to download, verify, extract, and configure the CMake tool for use in the build process. The first step involves downloading a specific version of CMake from a URL and verifying its integrity using a SHA-256 checksum. The second step extracts the downloaded CMake archive into a specified directory. Finally, the third step updates the system's PATH environment variable to include the directory where CMake's binaries are located, ensuring that CMake can be executed from the command line during subsequent build tasks.
