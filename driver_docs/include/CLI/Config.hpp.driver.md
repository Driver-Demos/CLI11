# Purpose
This C++ header file is part of the CLI11 library, which is designed to facilitate the creation and management of command-line interfaces. The file primarily focuses on configuration-related utilities within the CLI11 namespace, specifically under the `detail` namespace, indicating that these functions are intended for internal use rather than public API exposure. The file includes several utility functions that handle string manipulation and configuration parsing tasks, such as converting arguments for INI files, joining strings with specific formatting, and cleaning or generating names and parent sections for configuration items. These functions are crucial for processing and organizing command-line arguments and configuration data in a structured manner.

The file includes necessary standard library headers and other components of the CLI11 library, such as "App.hpp" and "StringTools.hpp," which suggests that it relies on broader functionalities provided by these components. The use of `#pragma once` ensures that the file is included only once in a single compilation, preventing duplicate definitions. Additionally, the file includes conditional compilation directives to include an implementation file, "Config_inl.hpp," if `CLI11_COMPILE` is not defined, which suggests a separation of interface and implementation to optimize compilation and maintain code organization. Overall, this file is a specialized component of the CLI11 library, focusing on internal configuration handling utilities.
