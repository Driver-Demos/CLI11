- **[Encoding.hpp](CLI/Encoding.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Encoding.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides functions for converting between wide and narrow strings, and includes additional functionality for handling filesystem paths when supported.
- **[Error.hpp](CLI/Error.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Error.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines a hierarchy of error classes for handling various error conditions related to command-line interface parsing and construction, including specific errors like `ConstructionError`, `ParseError`, and `OptionNotFound`.
- **[Formatter.hpp](CLI/Formatter.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Formatter.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase is a header file that includes necessary libraries and headers for formatting functionality within the CLI11 library.
- **[FormatterFwd.hpp](CLI/FormatterFwd.hpp.driver.md)**: The `FormatterFwd.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines the base and specialized classes for formatting help output in command-line applications, including customizable options for column widths and formatting styles.
- **[Macros.hpp](CLI/Macros.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Macros.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines a series of preprocessor macros for handling C++ version detection, deprecation attributes, RTTI usage, and feature availability such as `<filesystem>` and `<codecvt>`.
- **[Option.hpp](CLI/Option.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Option.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase defines classes and functionalities for handling command-line options, including setting and retrieving option properties, managing multi-option policies, and validating input.
- **[Split.hpp](CLI/Split.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Split.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides utility functions for parsing and splitting command-line option strings into short, long, and Windows-style options, as well as extracting default flag values.
- **[StringTools.hpp](CLI/StringTools.hpp.driver.md)**: The `StringTools.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a collection of utility functions for string manipulation, including trimming, joining, splitting, and handling of quoted and escaped strings, as well as support for enum streaming.
- **[Timer.hpp](CLI/Timer.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Timer.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a simple timer class with customizable pretty printing and an `AutoTimer` class that prints the elapsed time upon destruction.
- **[TypeTools.hpp](CLI/TypeTools.hpp.driver.md)**: The `TypeTools.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive set of utilities and type traits for type enabling, type classification, and lexical casting, supporting various operations such as type conversion, string conversion, and type categorization.
- **[Validators.hpp](CLI/Validators.hpp.driver.md)**: The `Validators.hpp` file in the `CLI11` codebase provides a comprehensive set of classes and functions for validating and transforming command-line input, including checks for file existence, IP address validation, and unit conversion, among others.
